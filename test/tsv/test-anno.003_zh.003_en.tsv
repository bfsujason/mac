我后来又见到陈清扬，和她在饭店里登记了房间，然后一起到房间里去，我伸手帮她脱下大衣。	Later I saw Chen Qingyang again. We registered for a room at a hotel, went in together, and then I helped her take off her coat.
陈清扬说，王二变得文明了。	Chen Qingyang said, Wang Er has become civilized.
这说明我已经变了很多。	It meant I had changed a lot.
以前我不但相貌凶恶，行为也很凶恶。	In the old days, I did not just look ferocious, but also acted ferociously.
我和陈清扬在饭店里又做了一回案。	Chen Qingyang and I committed the crime one more time in the hotel.
那里暖气烧得很暖，还装着茶色玻璃。	The room was well heated, and the windows were glazed with tea-colored panes.
我坐在沙发上，她坐在床上，聊了一会儿天， 逐渐有了犯罪的气氛。	I sat on the sofa, and she sat in the bed. We chatted for a while, and then the criminal atmosphere began to build.
我说，不是让我看有多耷拉吗，我看看。	I said, Didn't you want me to see how they sag now? Let me take a look!
她就站起来，脱了外衣，里面穿着大花的衬衫。	So she got to her feet and took off her sweater—she had on a flowery shirt underneath.
然后她又坐下去，说，还早一点。	Then she sat back and said, It's still early.
过一会服务员来送开水。	After a while, the attendant brought us boiling water.
他们有钥匙，连门都不敲就进来了。	They had keys, so they just came in without even knocking on the door.
我问她，碰上了人家怎么说？	I asked, What would the attendant say if he came in right in the middle of things?
她说，她没被碰上过。 但是听说人家会把门一摔，在外面说：真他妈的讨厌！	She said she had never gotten caught in the act, but she had heard that the attendant would slam the door shut and curse, Motherfuckers! Disgusting!
我和陈清扬逃进山以前，有一次我在猪场煮猪食。	Before Chen Qingyang and I escaped into the mountains, I cooked pig feed for a while.
那时我要烧火，要把猪菜切碎（所谓猪菜，是番薯藤、水葫芦一类东西），要往锅里加糠添水。	At the time I had to tend the fire, chop the pig feed (the so-called pig feed consisted of things like sweet potato vine and water hyacinth), and add chaff and water to the wok all by myself.
我同时做着好几样事情。 而军代表却在一边碟碟不休，说我是如何之坏。 他还让我去告诉我的“臭婊子”陈清扬，她是如何之坏。	As I bustled around doing several things at once, the military deputy stood beside me, talking his head off. He went on nagging about how bad I was, and how bad Chen Qingyang was, even asking me to pass the message to my "stinking whore" Chen Qingyang.
忽然间我暴怒起来，抡起长勺，照着粱上挂的盛南瓜籽的葫芦劈去，把它劈成两半。	All of a sudden, I flew into a fury. I grabbed a machete and slashed at a bottle gourd used for storing pumpkin seeds that hung on the beam, cutting it in half.
军代表吓得一步跳出房去。	Frightened, the military deputy leaped out of the room.
如果他还要继续数落我，我就要砍他脑袋了。	If he had kept scolding, I would have cut his head off.
我是那样凶恶，因为我不说话。	I appeared especially ferocious, because I didn't speak.
后来在人保组，我也不大说话，包括人家捆我的时候。	Later, in the public security office, I didn't talk much either, even when they were tying me up.
所以我的手经常被捆得乌青。	So my hands often turned dark blue.
陈清扬经常说话。	Chen Qingyang talked all the time.
她说：大嫂，捆疼了。 或者：大嫂，给我拿手绢垫一垫。	She would say something like this: Big sister, it hurts! or, Big sister, can you tuck a handkerchief under the rope?
我头发上系了一块手绢。	There is a handkerchief holding my hair.
她处处与人合作，苦头吃得少。	She cooperated at every point, which was why she suffered much less than I did.
我们处处都不一样。	We were different in every way.
陈清扬说，以前我不够文明。	Chen Qingyang said that back then I wasn't very civilized.
在人保组里，人家给我们松了绑。	When we went back to the public security office, people untied us.
那条绳子在她的衬衣上留下了很多道痕迹。 这是因为那绳子平时放在烧火的棚子里，沾上了锅灰和柴草沫。	The rope left lines of smudge on her shirt, which was because the rope was stored in a kitchen shed and picked up ash from the bottom of woks and bits of firewood.
她用不灵活的手把痕迹掸掉，只掸了前面，掸不了后面。	She tried to flick the ashes off with her stiff fingers, but could only do the front, not the back.
等到她想叫我来掸时，我已经一步跨出门去。	By the time she wanted to ask me to help her, I had already strode out of the room.
等到她追出门去，我已经走了很远，我走路很快，而且从来不回头看。	She followed out the door, but I had gone pretty far. I walked very fast, never looking back.
就因为这些原因，她根本就不爱我，也说不上喜欢。	Because of these things, she didn't love me at all; she didn't even like me.
照领导定的性，我们在后山上干的事，除了她像考拉那次之外，都不算案子。	According to the leaders, what we did on the back slope was not considered a primary offense—except the time that she looked like a koala bear.
像我们在开荒时干的事，只能算枝节问题。	For example, the thing we did while cultivating the wilderness was just a secondary offense.
所以我没有继续交待下去。	So I didn't finish my confession.
其实还有别的事。	There was actually something more.
当时热风正烈，陈清扬头枕双臂睡得很熟。	A hot wind blew really hard at the time and Chen Qingyang slept soundly with her arms under her head.
我把她的衣襟完全解开了。 这样她袒露出上身，好像是故意的一样。	I unbuttoned all the buttons on her shirt so she was half naked. It looked like she had done it herself.
天又蓝又亮，以致阴影里都是蓝黝黝的光。	The sky was so blue and bright that you could even see blue light in the shadows.
忽然间我心里一动，在她红彤彤的身体上俯身下去。	All of a sudden, I felt tenderness in my heart, so I bent over her reddened body.
我都忘了自己干了些什么了。	I'd forgotten what I did then.
我把这事说了出来，以为陈清扬一定不记得。	When I mentioned this to Chen Qingyang, I thought she'd have forgotten.
可是她说，“记得记得！	But she said, "I remember, I remember.
那会儿我醒了。	I was already awake by that time.
你在我肚脐上亲了一下吧？	You kissed my belly button, right?
好危险，差一点爱上你。”	I was just on the edge—I almost fell in love with you at that moment."
陈清扬说，当时她刚好醒来，看见我那颗乱蓬蓬的头正在她肚子上，然后肚脐上轻柔的一触。	Chen Qingyang said that she had just awakened in time to see my tousled head on her belly, and then she felt a gentle touch on her navel.
那一刻她也不能自持。 但是她还是假装睡着，看我还要干什么。	For a moment she could hardly restrain herself, but she still pretended to sleep, waiting to see what else I would do.
可是我什么都没干，抬起头来往四下看看，就走开了。	But I didn't do anything. I raised my head and looked around. And then I walked away.
我写的交待材料里说，那天夜里，我们离开后山，向做案现场进发，背上背了很多坛坛罐罐，计划是到南边山里定居。	My confession says that on that night, we left the back slope and set off for the crime scene. We carried pots and pans on our backs and planned to settle down on the mountain in the south.
那边土地肥沃，公路两边就是一人深的草。 不像十五队后山，草只有半尺高。	Over there the soil was so much richer that the grasses on both sides of the road stood as tall as people, unlike the back slope of the fifteenth team where they were about half a foot.
那天夜里有月亮，我们还走了一段公路，所以到天明将起雾时，已经走了二十公里，上了南面的山。	The moon shone that night. We even walked on the road for a while. By the time fog rose at daybreak, we had walked twelve miles and went up to the mountain in the south.
具体地说，到了章风寨南面的草地上，再走就是森林。	To be more specific, we arrived at the grassland to the south of Zhang Feng village and the forest wasn't far off.
我们在一棵大青树下露营，拣了两块干牛粪生了一堆火，在地上铺了一块塑料布。	We camped under a huge green tree, picking up two pieces of cow dung to start a fire, and spread a plastic sheet on the ground.
然后脱了一切衣服（衣服已经湿了），搂在一起，裹上三条毯子，滚成一个球，就睡着了。	Then we took off all our clothes (the clothes were drenched by then), cuddled into each other, wrapped ourselves in three blankets, and then fell asleep.
睡了一个小时就被冻醒。	We woke up frozen after an hour.
三重毯子都湿透了，牛粪火也灭了。	The three layers of blankets were all soaked, and the dung fire had died out, too.
树上的水滴像倾盆大雨往下掉。 空气里漂着的水点有绿豆大小。	Dewdrops fell from the trees in a downpour, and even the drops floating in the air were as big as mung beans.
那是在一月里，旱季最冷的几天。	This was in January, the coldest days of the dry season.
山的阴面就有这么潮。	The shady side of the mountain could be that damp.
陈清扬说，她醒时，听见我在她耳边打机关枪。	Chen Qingyang said when she woke up she heard my teeth chattering like a machine gun by her ear.
上牙碰下牙，一秒钟不只一下。	The upper teeth were clicking against the lower more than once a second.
而且我已经有了热度。	I already had a temperature.
我一感冒就不容易好，必须打针。	Once I caught a cold, it would be hard to recover unless I got a shot.
她就爬起来说，不行，这样两个人都要病。	So she sat up and said, Enough. Both of us will get sick this way.
快干那事。	Hurry, we have to do the thing.
我不肯动，说道：忍忍罢。	Not wanting to move, I said, Hold on for a bit.
一会儿就出太阳。	The sun is coming out soon.
后来又说：你看我干得了吗？	After a few minutes I said, Do you think I have energy to do it now?
案发前的情况就是这样的。	That was the situation prior to the offense.
案发时的情形是这样：陈清扬骑在我身上，一起一落，她背后的天上是白茫茫的雾气。	The offense went as follows: Chen Qingyang rode my body, up and down; behind her back was a broad expanse of white fog.
这时好像不那么冷了，四下里传来牛铃声。	It didn't feel that cold anymore, and the sound of buffalo bells floated all around.
这地方的老傣不关牛，天一亮水牛就自己跑出来。	Since Thai people here didn't pen their buffaloes, they would ramble at daybreak.
那些牛身上拴着木制的铃裆，走起来发出闷闷的响声。	Hung with wooden bells, the buffaloes would make clunking sounds as they walked.
一个庞然大物骤然出现在我们身边，耳边的刚毛上挂着水珠。	A hulk suddenly turned up beside us, with dewdrops dangling from a hairy ear.
那是一条白水牛，它侧过头来，用一只眼睛看我们。	It was a white buffalo, who turned its head and stared at us with one of its eyes.
白水牛的角可以做刀把，晶莹透明很好看。	A white buffalo's horn can be used to make a knife handle, glittering and crystal clear, very pretty.
可是质脆容易裂。	But its texture is brittle, easy to crack.
我有一把匕首，也是白牛角把，却一点不裂，很难得。	I used to have a dagger with a white-horn handle that didn't have any cracks, which was very unusual.
刃的材料也好，可是被人保组收走了。	The blade was also made of excellent materials. Unfortunately public security confiscated it.
后来没事了，找他们要，却说找不到了。	I asked them to return it to me after my case was cleared. They said they couldn't find it.
还有我的猎枪，也不肯还我。	They didn't return my hunting gun either.
人保组的老郭死乞白咧地说要买，可是只肯出五十块钱。	Old Guo from the public security section promised shamelessly to buy it, but he only wanted to pay fifty yuan.
最后连枪带刀，我一样也没要回来。	In the end I got nothing back, not my gun or my knife.
我和陈清扬在饭店里做案之前聊了好半天。	Chen Qingyang and I chatted for a long time before we committed our crime in the hotel room.
最后她把衬衣也脱下来，还穿着裙子和皮靴。	Finally, she took off her shirt, but still wore her skirt and leather boots.
我走过去坐在她身边，把她的头发撩了起来。 她的头发有不少白的了。	I went over to sit next to her and moved her hair back; some of it had turned gray.
陈清扬烫了头。	Chen Qingyang had permed her hair.
她说，以前她的头发好，舍不得烫。	She said she used to have excellent hair and didn't want to perm it.
现在没关系了。	Now it didn't matter anymore.
她现在当了副院长，非常忙，也不能每天洗头。	As the assistant head of the hospital, she was very busy and couldn't even find time to wash her hair every day.
除此之外，眼角脖子下有不少皱纹。	Other than that, the corners of her eyes and her neck had begun to crease.
她说，女儿建议她去做整容手术。 但是她没时间做。	She said her daughter suggested that she have plastic surgery, but she couldn't find time to do it.
后来她说，好啦，看罢。	At last she said, OK, now take a look at them.
就去解乳罩。	So she started to undo her bra.
我想帮她一把，也没帮上。	I wanted to help her, but I couldn't.
扣在前面，我把手伸到后面去了。	The clasp was in the front, but I reached around to her back.
她说看来你没学坏，就转过身来让我看。	She said, Looks like you haven't learned what it takes to be bad. And then she turned to let me see her breasts.
我仔细看了一阵，提了一点意见。	I looked carefully at them for a while, and gave her my opinion.
不知为什么，她有点脸红，说，好啦，看也看过了。	For some reason, her face blushed a little. She said, Well, you've seen them.
还要干什么？	What else do you want to do?
就要把乳罩戴上。	As she said this, she began to put her bra back on.
我说，别忙，就这样罢。	I said, What's the hurry? Leave them out.
她说，怎么，还要研究我的结构？	She said, What? Still want to study my anatomy?
我说，那当然。	I said, Of course.
现在不着急，再聊一会。	But let's not rush. We can talk a little longer.
她的脸更红了，说道：王二，你一辈子学不了好，永远是个混蛋。	The color in her face deepened. She said, Wang Er, you'll never learn how to be good. You'll always be a bastard!
我在人保组，罗小四来看我，趴窗户一看，我被捆得像粽子一样。	When I was detained in the public security section, Luo Xiaosi came to see me. He leaned on the windowsill and found me tied up like a package.
他以为案情严重，我会被枪毙掉，把一盒烟从窗里扔进来，说道：二哥，哥们儿一点意思。	Believing that my case was very serious and I might be shot soon, he tossed a box of cigarettes in from the window and said, Brother Er, just a little gift.
然后哭了。	Then he burst into tears.
罗小四感情丰富，很容易哭。	Luo Xiaosi was a sentimental man, easily touched.
我让他点着了烟从窗口递进来，他照办了，差点肩关节脱臼才递到我嘴上。	I asked him to light a cigarette and hand it to me through the window. He did as I asked, almost dislocating his shoulder to reach me.
然后他问我还有什么事要办，我说没有。	After that he asked me what else he could do for me. I said nothing else.
我还说，你别招一大群人来看我。	I also said, Don't bring a crowd to see me.
他也照办了。	He promised he wouldn't.
他走后，又有一帮孩子爬上窗台看，正看见我被烟熏的睁一眼闭一眼，样子非常难看。	After he was gone, a gang of boys climbed up to the window ledge to see me. Right then the cigarette smoke choked me, and with one eye open and the other closed I looked terrible.
打头的一个不禁说道：耍流氓。	The leader of the boys couldn't help crying out: Hooligan!
我说，你爸你妈才耍流氓，他们不流氓能有你？	I answered back, Your father and mother are hooligans! If they're not hooligans, where did a little hooligan like you come from?
那孩子抓了些泥巴扔我。	The boy grabbed some dirt and flung it at me.
等把我放开，我就去找他爸，说道：今天我在人保组，被人像捆猪一样捆上。	After I was released, I went to see the boy's father and said: Today I was in the public security office. I was hog-tied.
令郎人小志大，趁那时朝我扔泥巴。	Your son is young, but he has great ambition. He took the opportunity to fling dirt at me.
那人一听，揪住他儿子就揍。	After hearing this, the man grabbed his son and beat the shit out of the little bastard.
我在一边看完了才走。	I didn't leave until I witnessed the whole episode.
陈清扬听说这事，就有这种评价：王二，你是个混蛋。	When Chen Qingyang heard this, she commented, Wang Er, you're a bastard!
其实我并非永远是混蛋。	Actually I'm not always a bastard.
我现在有家有口，已经学了不少好。	Now that I have a wife and family, I have learned a lot about how to be good.
抽完了那根烟，我把她抱过来，很熟练地在她胸前爱抚一番，然后就想脱她的裙子。	After finishing the cigarette, I drew her to me, fondled her breasts skillfully for a while, and then wanted to take off her skirt.
她说：别忙，再聊会儿。	She said, No rush. Let's talk a little more.
你给我也来支烟。	Give me a cigarette too.
我点了一支烟，抽着了给她。	So I lit a cigarette, took a drag, and handed it to her.
陈清杨说，在章风山她骑在我身上一上一下，极目四野，都是灰蒙蒙的水雾。	Chen Qingyang said on Mount Zhang Feng, when she rode up and down on my body, she looked far and near, and saw nothing but gray, watery fog floating in the air.
忽然间觉得非常寂寞，非常孤独。	All of a sudden, she felt very alone, very lonely.
虽然我的一部分在她身体里磨擦，她还是非常寂寞，非常孤独。	Even though a part of me was rubbing inside her body, she still felt sad and lonely.
后来我活过来了，说道：换换，你看我的，我就翻到上面去。	After a while I came back to life and said: Let's switch. Here we go. So I rolled over onto her body.
她说， 那一回你比哪回都混蛋。	She said, That time, you were a bigger bastard than ever.
陈清扬说，那回我比哪回都混蛋，是指我忽然发现她的脚很小巧好看。	When Chen Qingyang said I was a bigger bastard than ever, she meant that I suddenly noticed her feet were cute and pretty.
因此我说，老陈，我准备当个拜脚狂。	I said, Old Chen, I've decided to be a foot fetishist.
然后我把她两腿捧起来，吻她的脚心。	Then I raised her legs and started to kiss the soles of her feet.
陈清扬平躺在草地上，两手摊开，抓着草。 忽然她一晃头，用头发盖住了脸，然后哼了一声。	Chen Qingyang lay on the grass with her arms spread out and her hands grabbing the grass, and then she turned her head aside, her hair covering her face, and moaned.
我在交待材料里写道，那时我放开她的腿，把她脸上的头发抚开。	In my confession I wrote: I let go of her legs and parted the hair on her face.
陈清扬猛烈地挣扎，流着眼泪，但是没有动手。	She struggled violently to break free, tears rolling down from her eyes, but she didn't slap me.
她脸上有两点很不健康的红晕。	There were two unhealthy red spots on her cheeks.
后来她不挣扎了，对我说，混蛋，你要把我怎么办。	After a while, she no longer struggled and said, You bastard! What are you going to do with me?
我说，怎么了。	I said, What's wrong?
她又笑，说道：不怎么。	She smiled and said, Nothing.
接着来。	Keep going.
所以我又捧起她的双腿。	So I raised her legs again.
她就那么躺着不动，双手平摊，牙咬着下唇，一声不响。	She lay like that motionless, her arms spread out, teeth biting her lower lip without uttering a sound.
如果我多看她一眼，她就笑笑。	If I looked at her again, she smiled back.
我记得她脸特别白，头发特别黑，整个情况就是这样的。	I remember her face was extremely pale, and her hair was especially dark. That's how the whole thing went.
陈清扬说，那一回她躺在冷雨里，忽然觉得每一个毛孔都进了冷雨。	Chen Qingyang said when she lay in the cold rain that time, she felt the chill penetrate every pore.
她感到悲从中来，不可断绝。	She felt an endless flow of sorrow.
忽然间一股巨大的快感劈进来。	Just then a huge surge of orgasm sliced through her body.
冷雾，雨水，都沁进了她的身体。	Cold fog and icy rain both seeped into her body.
那时节她很想死去。	For a moment she wanted to die.
她不能忍耐，想叫出来，但是看见了我她又不想叫出来。	She couldn't stand it; she wanted to cry out. But at the sight of me she changed her mind.
世界上还没有一个男人能叫她肯当着他的面叫出来。	There was no man in this world who could make her scream in front of him.
她和任何人都格格不入。	She felt disconnected from everyone.
陈清扬后来和我说，每回和我做爱都深受折磨。	Chen Qingyang told me later that she was deeply troubled every time I made love to her.
在内心深处她很想叫出来，想抱住我狂吻，但是她不乐意。	In the depth of her heart, she wanted to cry out, hug me, and kiss me passionately, but she couldn't bring herself to do it.
她不想爱别人，任何人都不爱；尽管如此，我吻她脚心时，一股辛辣的感觉还是钻到她心里来。	She didn't want to love other people, not even one. But still, when I kissed the soles of her feet that time, a sharp feeling still bored its way into her heart.
我和陈清扬在章风山上做爱，有一只老水牛在一边看。	When Chen Qingyang and I made love on Mount Zhang Feng, an old buffalo alongside us watched.
后来它哞了一声跑开了，只剩我们两人。	Later it lowed and ran away, leaving the two of us alone there.
过了很长时间，天渐渐亮了。 雾从天顶消散。	After a long while, the sky gradually lightened and the fog began to disappear from above us.
陈清扬的身体沾了露水，闪起光来。	Chen Qingyang's body glistened with dew.
我把她放开，站起来，看见离寨子很近，就说：走。	I let go of her and rose to my feet, to find that we were actually not far from the village. So I said, Let's go.
于是离开了那个地方，再没回去过。	We left that place and never went back.
我在交待材料里说，我和陈清扬在刘大爹后山上作案无数。	In my confession, I admitted that Chen Qingyang and I had committed crimes on numerous occasions on Grandpa Liu's back mountain.
这是因为刘大爹的地是熟地，开起来不那么费力。	This was because Grandpa Liu's fields had already been cultivated and didn't need much work.
生活也安定，所以温饱生淫欲。	So our life was relatively easy there. And since we didn't have to worry about food and shelter, we thought more about sex.
那片山上没人，刘大爹躺在床上要死了。	There was nobody else on that part of the mountain, and Grandpa Liu lay on his deathbed.
山上非雾即雨，陈清扬腰上束着我的板带，上面挂着刀子。	The mountain was either rainy or foggy. Chen Qingyang fastened my belt around her waist, with a knife dangling from it.
脚上穿高筒雨靴，除此之外不着一丝。	She wore high boots, and nothing else.
陈清扬后来说，她一辈子只交了我一个朋友。	Chen Qingyang told me later that she had made only one friend in her life, and that was me.
她说，这一切都是因为我在河边的小屋里谈到伟大友谊。	She said all that happened came about because I talked about great friendship in my small house by the river.
人活着总要做几件事情，这就是其中之一。	A person had to accomplish a few things in life and this was one of them.
以后她就没和任何人有过交情。	After that she didn't have deep relationships with other people.
同样的事做多了没意思。	It's no fun doing the same things over and over.
我对此早有预感。	I've had a feeling about this all along.
所以我向她要求此事时就说：老兄，咱们敦敦伟大友谊如何？	So whenever I asked her for sex, I would say, Old pal, how about strengthening our great friendship now?
人家夫妇敦伦，我们无伦可言，只好敦友谊。	Married couples have a code of ethics to strengthen, and we don't have that, so we can only strengthen our friendship.
她说好。	She said, No problem.
怎么敦？ 正着敦反着敦？	How do you want to strengthen it, from the front or from the back?
我说反着敦。	I said, From the back.
那时正在地头上。	We were at the edge of the field then.
因为是反着敦，就把两件蓑衣铺在地上，她趴在上面，像一匹马，说道：你最好快一点，刘大爹该打针了。	Because it was from the back, we had to spread two palm-bark rain capes on the ground. She knelt on her hands and knees, like a horse, and said, You'd better hurry. It's time to give Grandpa Liu a shot.
我把这些事写进了交待材料，领导上让我交待：1. 谁是“郭伦”；2. 什么叫“郭郭”伟大友谊；3 .什么叫正着郭，什么叫反着郭。	I wrote all these things in my confessions, but the leaders wanted me to confess in response to the following: 1. Who is Comrade Strain-thing Eh-thics? 2. What does "strengthening the great friendship" mean? 3. What is strengthening it from the back? And what is strengthening it from the front?
把这些都说清以后，领导上又叫我以后少掉文，是什么问题就交待什么问题。	After I cleared things up, the leaders told me not to play word games. Whatever my crimes were, they said, I needed to confess them.
在山上敦伟大友谊时，嘴里喷出白气。	While we were strengthening our great friendship on the mountain, white breath puffed from our mouths.
天不那么凉，可是很湿，抓过一把能拧出水来。	It was not that cold, but very humid. You could grab a handful of air and wring water out of it.
就在蓑衣旁边，蚯蚓在爬。	Worms wriggled next to our palm-bark rain capes.
那片地真肥。	That piece of land was really rich.
后来玉米还没熟透，我们就把它放在捣臼里捣，这是山上老景颇的做法。 做出的玉米粑粑很不坏。	Later on, before the corn fully ripened, we picked the ears and ground the kernels in a mortar. The Jingpos in the mountains prepared corn cakes that way, and they weren't bad at all.
在冷水里放着，好多天不坏。	Storing them in cold water could preserve them for a long time.
陈清扬趴在冷雨里，乳房摸起来像冷苹果。	As Chen Qingyang crouched on her hands and knees in the cold rain, her breasts felt like cool apples.
她浑身的皮肤绷紧，好像抛过光的大理石。	Her skin all over was as smooth as a piece of burnished marble.
后来我把小和尚拔出来，把精液射到地里。	After a while I pulled my little Buddha out and ejaculated onto the field.
她在一边看着，面带惊恐之状。	She looked back at this with a surprised and fearful expression.
我告诉她：这样地会更肥。	I told her that it would fertilize the land.
她说：我知道。	She said, I know.
后来又说：地里会不会长出小王二来——这像个大夫说的话吗？	And a moment later she asked, Will a little Wang Er grow out of the land?— Does this sound like something a doctor would say?
雨季过去后，我们化装成老傣，到清平赶街。	When the rainy season passed, we dressed like Thais and went to Qingping market.
后来的事我已经写过，我在清平遇上了同学。	As I've already written before, I met a classmate in Qingping.
虽然化了装，人家还是一眼就认出我来。	Although I was dressed like a Thai, he still recognized me on sight.
我的个子太高，装不矮。	I was too tall to be a Thai.
人家对我说：二哥，你跑哪儿去了？	He said, Hi, brother Er, where have you been?
我说：我不会讲汉话哟！	I said, I'm hopeless at speaking Mandarin.
虽然尽力加上一点怪腔，还是京片子。	Despite the fact that I tried very hard to speak in a weird accent, it still sounded like the Beijing dialect.
一句就露馅了。	That one sentence gave me away.
回到农场是她的主意。	It was her idea to go back to the farm.
我自己既然上了山，就不准备下去。	Since I myself had decided to go up the mountain, I was determined not to go back.
她和我上山，是为了伟大友谊。 我也不能不陪她下去。	She'd come to the mountains for the sake of our great friendship, so I couldn't refuse to go down the mountain with her.
其实我们随时可以逃走，但她不乐意。	Actually, we could have left anytime, but she didn't want to.
她说现在的生活很有趣。	She said our current life was fun.
陈清扬后来说，在山上她也觉得很有趣。	Later Chen Qingyang said life on the mountain was also fun.
漫山冷雾时，腰上别着刀子，足蹬高统雨靴，走到雨丝里去。	When cold mist drifted over the mountain, she would tuck a knife into her belt, put on a pair of rain boots, and enter the drizzle.
但是同样的事做多了就不再有趣。	But it's no fun doing the same things over and over.
所以她还想下山，忍受人世的摧残。	That was why she still wanted to come down the mountain, to put up with the torment of human society.
我和陈清扬在饭店里重温伟大友谊，说到那回从山上下来，走到岔路口上。	When Chen Qingyang and I relived our great friendship in the hotel room, we spoke of the time we came down the mountain and reached a junction of roads.
那地方有四条岔路，各通一方。	There were four byroads at that place, and each of them led in a single direction.
东西南北没有关系，一条通到国外，是未知之地； 一条通到内地；一条通到农场； 一条是我们来的路。 那条路还通到户撒。	East, west, south, north didn't really matter. One led abroad, to an unknown place; one to the interior; one to the farm; and one back to where we came from, and that road also led to Husha.
那里有很多阿伧铁匠，那些人世世代代当铁匠。	In Husha there were a lot of Ahcang blacksmiths, who had passed on the skill from generation to generation.
我虽然不是世世代代，但我也能当铁匠。	Though I didn't come from a family of smiths, I could have been a blacksmith.
我和那些人熟得很，他们都佩服我的技术。	I knew those people very well; they all admired my skill.
阿伧族的女人都很漂亮，身上挂了很多铜箍和银钱。	Ahcang women were all very pretty, their bodies adorned with many bronze bracelets and necklaces and silver coins.
陈清扬对那种打扮十分神往，她很想到山上去当个阿伧。	That kind of dress fascinated Chen Qingyang, and she wanted to go up to the mountains and become one of them.
那时雨季刚过，云从四面八方升起来。	At the time, the rainy season had just passed, and clouds rose up from every direction.
天顶上闪过一缕缕阳光。	Threads of sunshine flashed in the sky.
我们有各种选择，可以到各方向去。	We could have made any choice and set off in any direction.
所以我在路口上站了很久。	So I stood at the crossroads for a long time.
后来我回内地时，站在公路上等汽车，也有两种选择，可以等下去，也可以回农场去。	Later when I was going back to the interior, waiting for the bus by the road, I also had two choices: I could keep waiting, or return to the farm.
当我沿着一条路走下去的时候，心里总想着另一条路上的事。	When I walked along one path, I often thought about things that might happen on another path.
这种时候我心里很乱。	Then I would feel confused.
陈清扬说过，我天资中等，手很巧，人特别混。 这都是有所指的。	Chen Qingyang once said I was a man of average intelligence but with skillful hands, and very nutty, which all meant something.
说我天资中等，我不大同意。 说我特别混，事实俱在，不容抵赖。 至于说我手巧，可能是自己身上体会出来的。	Her saying my intelligence was only average, I didn't agree with; her saying I was nutty, I couldn't deny because it's a fact; as to my skillful hands, she probably knew that from her own body.
我的手的确很巧，不光表现在摸女人方面。	My hands are indeed very skillful, which wasn't just shown by how I touched women.
手掌不大，手指特长，可以做任何精细的工作。	My palms are not big, but my fingers are unusually long and able to perform any delicate and complex task.
山上那些阿伧铁匠打刀刃比我好，可是要比在刀上刻花纹，没有任何人能比得上。	Those Ahcang blacksmiths on the mountain were better than me at forging blades, but for etching designs on a knife no one could match me.
所以起码有二十个铁匠提出过，让我们搬过去，他打刀刃我刻花纹，我们搭一伙。	So, at least twenty blacksmiths invited us to move in with them. Each suggested that he would forge the blades and I would etch the designs, and we would make a good team.
假如当初搬了过去，可能现在连汉话都不会说了。	If I had moved in then, I probably would have forgotten how to speak Mandarin.
假如我搬到一位阿伧大哥那里去住，现在准在黑洞洞的铁匠铺里给户撒刀刻花纹。	If I had moved in with an Ahcang big brother, I would be etching designs on Husha knives in that dark, deep blacksmith shop now.
在他家泥泞的后院里，准有一大窝小崽子，共有四种组合形式：1. 陈清扬和我的；2. 阿伧大哥和阿伧大嫂的；3. 我和阿伧大嫂的；4. 陈清扬和阿伧大哥的。	In the muddy backyard of his house, there would be a brood of little children, comprised of four combinations: 1. Those produced by Chen Qingyang and me; 2. Those produced by Ahcang big brother and Ahcang big sister; 3. Those produced by Ahcang big sister and me; 4. Those produced by Chen Qingyang and Ahcang big brother.
陈清扬从山上背柴回来，撩起衣裳，露出极壮硕的乳房，不分青红皂白，就给其中一个喂奶。	When Chen Qingyang would come down from the mountain with firewood on her back, she would pull up her clothes, revealing her full and firm breasts, and, without making any distinction, feed one of the babies.
假如当初我退回山上去，这样的事就会发生。	If I had returned to the mountains then, that would have happened.
陈清扬说，这样的事不会发生，因为它没有发生，实际发生的是，我们回了农场，写交待材料出斗争差。	Chen Qingyang said such things wouldn't happen because they didn't happen. What really happened was that we returned to the farm, wrote confessions, and went on denouncement trips.
虽然随时都可以跑掉，但是没有跑。	Even though we could have run away at any minute, we never did.
这是真实发生了的事。	That was what really happened.
陈清扬说，我天资平常，她显然没把我的文学才能考虑在内。	When Chen Qingyang said I was of average intelligence, she obviously didn't consider my literary talent.
我写的交待材料人人都爱看。	Everyone loved to read the confessions I wrote.
刚开始写那些东西时，我有很大抵触情绪。	When I first started writing those things, I was dead set against it.
写着写着就入了迷。 这显然是因为我写的全是发生过的事。	But as I wrote more, I became obsessed, clearly because the things I wrote all happened.
发生过的事有无比的魅力。	Things that really happen have incomparable charm.
我在交待材料里写下了一切细节，但是没有写以下已经发生的事情：我和陈清扬在十五队后山上，在草房里干完后，到山涧里戏水。	I wrote down almost every detail in my confessions except the things that happened below: On the back mountain of the fifteenth team, after making love in our thatched hut, Chen Qingyang and I went to a creek to play in the water.
山上下来的水把红土剥光，露出下面的蓝粘土来。	The water from the mountain had washed away the red soil, exposing the blue clay underneath.
我们爬到蓝粘土上晒太阳。	We lay on the blue clay to sun ourselves.
暖过来后，小和尚又直立起来。	After I recovered my warmth, my little Buddha stood up again.
但是刚发泄过，不像急色鬼。	Since he had been relieved not long before, I was not as eager as a sex maniac.
于是我侧躺在她身后，枕着她的头发进入她的身体。	So I lay on my side behind her, pillowed on her long hair and entered her body from behind.
我们在饭店里，后来也是这么重温伟大友谊。	Later in the hotel room, we relived our great friendship in the same way.
我和陈清扬侧躺在蓝粘土上，那时天色将晚，风也有点凉。	When Chen Qingyang and I lay on our sides on the blue clay, it was getting dark and the wind had cooled a bit.
躺在一起心平气和，有时轻轻动一下。	It felt very peaceful lying together, and sometimes we moved a little.
据说海豚之间有生殖性的和娱乐性的两种搞法，这就是说，海豚也有伟大友谊。	I've heard that dolphins had two ways of doing it, one for procreation and the other for entertainment, which is to say that dolphins also have the great friendship.
我和陈清扬连在一起，好像两只海豚一样。	Chen Qingyang and I were connected, just like a pair of dolphins.
我和陈清扬在蓝粘土上，闭上眼睛，好像两只海豚在海里游动。	When Chen Qingyang and I lay on the blue clay with our eyes closed, we felt like a pair of dolphins swimming in the sea.
天黑下来，阳光逐渐红下去。	It was getting darker and the sunlight gradually reddened.
天边起了一片云，惨白惨白，翻着无数死鱼肚皮，瞪起无数死鱼眼睛。	A cloud came over the horizon, pale as countless dead fish bellies turned up and countless dead fish eyes gaping.
山上有一股风，无声无息地吹下去。 天地间充满了悲惨的气氛。	A current of wind slipped down the mountain without a sound, without a breath, and a sadness in the air filled every space between the sky and the earth.
陈清扬流了很多眼泪。	Chen Qingyang shed a lot of tears.
她说是触景伤情。	She said the scene depressed her.
我还存了当年交待材料的副本，有一回拿给一位搞英美文学的朋友看，他说很好，有维多利亚时期地下小说的韵味。	I still keep the duplicates of my confessions from back then. Once, I showed them to a friend who majored in English and American literature. He said they were all very good, with the charm of Victorian underground novels.
至于删去的细节，他也说删得好，那些细节破坏了故事的完整性。	As for the details I had cut out, he said it was a good idea to cut them out, because those details destroyed the unity of the story.
我的朋友真有大学问。	My friend is really erudite.
我写交待材料时很年轻，没什么学问（到现在也没有学问），不知道什么是维多利亚时期地下小说。	I was very young when I wrote the confessions and didn't have any learning (I still don't have much learning), or any idea what Victorian underground novels were.
我想的是不能教会了别人。	What I had in my mind was that I shouldn't be an instigator.
我这份交待材料不少人要看，假如他们看了情不自禁，也去搞破鞋，那倒不伤大雅，要是学会了这个，那可不大好。	Many people would read my confessions. If after reading them they couldn't help screwing damaged goods, that wasn't so bad; but if they learned the other thing, that would be really bad.
我在交待材料里还漏掉了以下事实，理由如前所述。	I also left out the facts that follow, for the same reason mentioned above.
我们犯了错误，本该被枪毙，领导上挽救我们，让我写交待材料，这是多么大的宽大！	We had committed many errors and deserved execution. But the leaders decided to save us, making me write confessions. How forgiving of them!
所以我下定决心，只写出我们是多么坏。	So I made up my mind that I would only write about how bad we were.
我们俩在刘大爹后山上时，陈清扬给自己做了一件筒裙，想穿了它化装成老傣，到清平去赶街。	When we lived on Grandpa Liu's back slope, Chen Qingyang made a Thai skirt for herself, disguising herself as a Thai woman so she could go to Qingping on market days.
可是她穿上以后连路都走不了啦。	But after putting the skirt on she could barely walk.
走到清平南边遇到一条河，山上下来的水像冰一样凉，像腌雪里一样绿。	South of Qingping, we ran into a river. The mountain water was ice-cold, and green as marinated mustard.
那水有齐腰深，非常急。	The water reached to my waist, and the current was very swift.
我走过去，把她用一个肩膀扛起来，径直走过河才放下来。	I walked over to her, hoisted her onto my shoulder, went right across the river, and then put her down.
我的一边肩膀正好和陈清扬的腰等宽，记得那时她的脸红得厉害。	Her waist was exactly the width of my shoulder. I remember her face turning deep red then.
我还说，我可以把你扛到清平去，再扛回来，比你扭扭捏捏地走更快。	I said, I could carry you to Qingping and back, faster than your swishy walking.
她说，去你妈的吧。	She said, Go take a crap.
筒裙就像个布筒子，下口只有一尺宽。	A Thai skirt is like a cloth sheath. The hem is only about a foot around.
会穿的人在里面可以干各种事，包括在大街上撒尿，不用蹲下来。	People who know how to wear them can do all kinds of things with them on, including peeing on the street without squatting down.
陈清扬说，这一手她永远学不会。	Chen Qingyang said she could never learn that trick.
在清平集上观摩了一阵，她得到了要扮就扮阿伧的结论。	After conducting an observation for a while in Qingping market, she drew the conclusion that if she wanted to disguise herself like someone, she would rather be an Ahcang woman.
回来的路是上山，而且她的力气都耗光了。	On the way back, the mountain road was all uphill, and she was exhausted, too.
每到跨沟越坎之处，她就找个树墩子，姿仪万方地站上去，让我扛她。	So whenever we needed to jump over a ditch or cross a ridge, she would find a stump, gracefully mount it, and let me carry her.
回来的路上扛着她爬坡。	So on the way home I carried her on my shoulder climbing the hills.
那时旱季刚到，天上白云纵横，阳光灿烂。	The dry season had just arrived, white clouds coasted through the sky, and the sun gave brilliant light.
可是山里还时有小雨。	But in the mountains it would drizzle from time to time.
红土的大板块就分外地滑。	The red clay was very slippery.
我走上那块烂泥板，就像初次上冰场。	Walking on slabs of red mud was like learning to skate for the first time.
那时我右手扣住她的大腿，左手提着猎枪，背上还有一个背篓，走在那滑溜溜的斜面上，十分吃力。	So with my right hand locked around her thighs and my left hand carrying the rifle, not to mention the basket on my back, I could hardly manage the slippery incline.
忽然间我向左边滑动，马上要滑进山沟，幸亏手里有条枪，拿枪拄在地上。	All of a sudden, I slipped to the left, and was about to fall into the valley. Fortunately I had a rifle, which I used to hold me up.
那时我全身绷紧，拼了老命，总算支持住了。	I tensed my whole body and struggled to keep us from going over.
可这个笨蛋还来添乱，在我背上扑腾起来，让我放她下去。	But the idiot picked that moment to give me trouble, flopping around on my back and demanding that I put her down.
那一回差一点死了。	We almost lost our lives that time.
等我刚能喘过气来，就把枪带交到右手，抡起左手在她屁股上狠狠打了两巴掌。	As soon as I caught my breath, I switched the rifle to my right hand, raised my left hand, and slapped her bottom really hard.
隔了薄薄一层布，倒显得格外光滑。	Through the layer of thin cloth, it felt unusually smooth.
她的屁股很圆。	Her bottom was very round.
鸡巴，感觉非常之好的啦！	Fuck, I felt terrific.
她挨了那两下登时老实了。	She immediately behaved herself after getting spanked.
非常地乖，一声也不吭。	She became very submissive, not saying another word.
当然打陈清扬屁股也不是好事，但是我想别的破鞋和野汉子之间未必有这样的事。	Of course, it was wrong to slap her bottom, but I thought this kind of thing might not be what other damaged goods and their lovers get into.
这件事离了题，所以就没写。	So the incident seemed beside the point and I didn't write about it.
