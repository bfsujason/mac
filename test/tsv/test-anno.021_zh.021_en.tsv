疯狂年代	The Madness Years
中国，1967年。	China, 1967
“红色联合”对“四·二八兵团”总部大楼的攻击已持续了两天，他们的旗帜在大楼周围躁动地飘扬着，仿佛渴望干柴的火种。	The Red Union had been attacking the headquarters of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade for two days. Their red flags fluttered restlessly around the brigade building like flames yearning for firewood.
“红色联合”的指挥官心急如焚，他并不惧怕大楼的守卫者，那二百多名“四·二八”战士，与诞生于l966年初、经历过大检阅和大串联的“红色联合”相比要稚嫩许多。	The Red Union commander was anxious, though not because of the defenders he faced. The more than two hundred Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade were mere greenhorns compared with the veteran Red Guards of the Red Union, which was formed at the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in early 1966. The Red Union had been tempered by the tumultuous experience of revolutionary tours around the country and seeing Chairman Mao in the great rallies in Tiananmen Square.
他怕的是大楼中那十几个大铁炉子，里面塞满了烈性炸药，用电雷管串联起来，他看不到它们，但能感觉到它们磁石般的存在，开关一合，玉石俱焚，而“四·二八”的那些小红卫兵们是有这个精神力量的。	But the commander was afraid of the dozen or so iron stoves inside the building, filled with explosives and connected to each other by electric detonators. He couldn't see them, but he could feel their presence like iron sensing the pull of a nearby magnet. If a defender flipped the switch, revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries alike would all die in one giant ball of fire. And the young Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade were indeed capable of such madness.
比起已经在风雨中成熟了许多的第一代红卫兵，新生的造反派们像火炭上的狼群，除了疯狂还是疯狂。	Compared with the weathered men and women of the first generation of Red Guards, the new rebels were a pack of wolves on hot coals, crazier than crazy.
大楼顶上出现了一个娇小的身影，那个美丽的女孩子挥动着一面“四·二八”的大旗，她的出现立刻招来了一阵杂乱的枪声，射击的武器五花八门，有陈旧的美式卡宾枪、捷克式机枪和三八大盖，也有崭新的制式步枪和冲锋枪——后者是在“八月社论”发表之后从军队中偷抢来的——连同那些梭标和大刀等冷兵器，构成了一部浓缩的近现代史……	The slender figure of a beautiful young girl emerged at the top of the building, waving the giant red banner of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade. Her appearance was greeted immediately by a cacophony of gunshots. The weapons attacking her were a diverse mix: antiques such as American carbines, Czech-style machine guns, Japanese Type-38 rifles; newer weapons such as standard-issue People's Liberation Army rifles and submachine guns, stolen from the PLA after the publication of the "August Editorial"; and even a few Chinese dadao swords and spears. Together, they formed a condensed version of modern history.
“四·二八”的人在前面多次玩过这个游戏，在楼顶上站出来的人，除了挥舞旗帜外，有时还用喇叭筒喊口号或向下撒传单，每次他们都能在弹雨中全身而退，为自己挣到了崇高的荣誉。	Numerous members of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade had engaged in similar displays before. They'd stand on top of the building, wave a flag, shout slogans through megaphones, and scatter flyers at the attackers below. Every time, the courageous man or woman had been able to retreat safely from the hailstorm of bullets and earn glory for their valor.
这次出来的女孩儿显然也相信自己还有那样的幸运。	The new girl clearly thought she'd be just as lucky.
她挥舞着战旗，挥动着自己燃烧的青春，敌人将在这火焰中化为灰烬，理想世界明天就会在她那沸腾的热血中诞生……	She waved the battle banner as though brandishing her burning youth, trusting that the enemy would be burnt to ashes in the revolutionary flames, imagining that an ideal world would be born tomorrow from the ardor and zeal coursing through her blood....
她陶醉在这鲜红灿烂的梦幻中，直到被一颗步枪子弹洞穿了胸膛，十五岁少女的胸膛是那么柔嫩，那颗子弹穿过后基本上没有减速，在她身后的空中发出一声啾鸣。	She was intoxicated by her brilliant, crimson dream until a bullet pierced her chest. Her fifteen-year-old body was so soft that the bullet hardly slowed down as it passed through it and whistled in the air behind her.
年轻的红卫兵同她的旗帜一起从楼顶落下，她那轻盈的身体落得甚至比旗帜还慢，仿佛小鸟眷恋着天空。	The young Red Guard tumbled down along with her flag, her light form descending even more slowly than the piece of red fabric, like a little bird unwilling to leave the sky.
“红色联合”的战士们欢呼起来，几个人冲到楼下，掀开四·二八的旗帜，抬起下面纤小的遗体，作为一个战利品炫耀地举了一段，然后将她高高地扔向大院的铁门。	The Red Union warriors shouted in joy. A few rushed to the foot of the building, tore away the battle banner of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, and seized the slender, lifeless body. They raised their trophy overhead and flaunted it for a while before tossing it toward the top of the metal gate of the compound.
铁门上带尖的金属栅条大部分在武斗初期就被抽走当梭镖了，剩下的两条正好挂住了她，那一瞬间，生命似乎又回到了那个柔软的躯体。	Most of the gate's metal bars, capped with sharp tips, had been pulled down at the beginning of the factional civil wars to be used as spears, but two still remained. As their sharp tips caught the girl, life seemed to return momentarily to her body.
红色联合的红卫兵们退后一段距离，将那个挂在高处的躯体当靶子练习射击，密集的子弹对她来说已柔和如雨，不再带来任何感觉。	The Red Guards backed up some distance and began to use the impaled body for target practice. For her, the dense storm of bullets was now no different from a gentle rain, as she could no longer feel anything.
她那春藤般的手臂不时轻挥一下，仿佛拂去落在身上的雨滴，直到那颗年轻的头颅被打掉了一半，仅剩的一只美丽的眼睛仍然凝视着一九六七年的蓝天，目光中没有痛苦，只有凝固的激情和渴望。	From time to time, her vinelike arms jerked across her body softly, as though she were flicking off drops of rain. And then half of her young head was blown away, and only a single, beautiful eye remained to stare at the blue sky of 1967. There was no pain in that gaze, only solidified devotion and yearning.
其实，比起另外一些人来，她还是幸运的，至少是在为理想献身的壮丽激情中死去。	And yet, compared to some others, she was fortunate. At least she died in the throes of passionately sacrificing herself for an ideal.
这样的热点遍布整座城市，像无数并行运算的CPU，将“文革大革命”联为一个整体。	Battles like this one raged across Beijing like a multitude of CPUs working in parallel, their combined output, the Cultural Revolution.
疯狂如同无形的洪水，将城市淹没其中，并渗透到每一个细微的角落和缝隙。	A flood of madness drowned the city and seeped into every nook and cranny.
在城市边缘的那所著名大学的操场上，一场几千人参加的批斗会已经进行了近两个小时。	At the edge of the city, on the exercise grounds of Tsinghua University, a mass "struggle session" attended by thousands had been going on for nearly two hours.
	This was a public rally intended to humiliate and break down the enemies of the revolution through verbal and physical abuse until they confessed to their crimes before the crowd.
在这个派别林立的年代，任何一处都有错综复杂的对立派别在格斗。	As the revolutionaries had splintered into numerous factions, opposing forces everywhere engaged in complex maneuvers and contests.
在校园中，红卫兵、文革工作组、工宣队和军宣队，相互之间都在爆发尖锐的冲突，而每种派别的内部又时时分化出新的对立派系，捍卫着各自不同的背景和纲领，爆发更为残酷的较量。	Within the university, intense conflicts erupted between the Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution Working Group, the Workers' Propaganda Team, and the Military Propaganda Team. And each faction divided into new rebel groups from time to time, each based on different backgrounds and agendas, leading to even more ruthless fighting.
但这次被批斗的反动学术权威，却是任何一方均无异议的斗争目标，他们也只能同时承受来自各方的残酷打击。	But for this mass struggle session, the victims were the reactionary bourgeois academic authorities. These were the enemies of every faction, and they had no choice but to endure cruel attacks from every side.
与其他的牛鬼蛇神相比，反动学术权威有他们的特点：当打击最初到来时，他们的表现往往是高傲而顽固的，这也是他们伤亡率最高的阶段。	Compared to other "Monsters and Demons," reactionary academic authorities were special: During the earliest struggle sessions, they had been both arrogant and stubborn. That was also the stage in which they had died in the largest numbers.
在首都，四十天的时间里就有一千七百多名批斗对象被活活打死，更多的人选择了更快捷的路径来逃避疯狂：老舍、吴晗、翦伯赞、傅雷、赵九章、以群、闻捷、海默等，都自己结束了他们那曾经让人肃然起敬的生命。	Over a period of forty days, in Beijing alone, more than seventeen hundred victims of struggle sessions were beaten to death. Many others picked an easier path to avoid the madness: Lao She, Wu Han, Jian Bozan, Fu Lei, Zhao Jiuzhang, Yi Qun, Wen Jie, Hai Mo, and other once-respected intellectuals had all chosen to end their lives.
从这一阶段幸存下来的人，在持续的残酷打击下渐渐麻木，这是一种自我保护的精神外壳，使他们避免最后的崩溃。	Those who survived that initial period gradually became numb as the ruthless struggle sessions continued. The protective mental shell helped them avoid total breakdown.
他们在批斗会上常常进入半睡眠状态，只有一声恫吓才能使其惊醒过来，机械地重复那已说过无数遍的认罪词。	They often seemed to be half asleep during the sessions and would only startle awake when someone screamed in their faces to make them mechanically recite their confessions, already repeated countless times.
然后，他们中的一部分人便进入了第三阶段，旷日持久的批判将鲜明的政治图像如水银般注入了他们的意识，将他们那由知识和理性构筑的思想大厦彻底摧毁，他们真的相信自己有罪，真的看到了自己对伟大事业构成的损害，并为此痛哭流涕，他们的忏悔往往比那此非知识分子的牛鬼蛇神要深刻得多，也真诚得多。	Then, some of them entered a third stage. The constant, unceasing struggle sessions injected vivid political images into their consciousness like mercury, until their minds, erected upon knowledge and rationality, collapsed under the assault. They began to really believe that they were guilty, to see how they had harmed the great cause of the revolution. They cried, and their repentance was far deeper and more sincere than that of those Monsters and Demons who were not intellectuals.
而对于红卫兵来说，进入后两个阶段的批判对象是最乏味的，只有处于第一阶段的牛鬼蛇神才能对他们那早已过度兴奋的神经产生有效的刺激，如同斗牛士手上的红布，但这样的对象越来越少了，在这所大学中可能只剩下一个，他由于自己的珍稀而被留到批判大会最后出场。	For the Red Guards, heaping abuse upon victims in those two latter mental stages was utterly boring. Only those Monsters and Demons who were still in the initial stage could give their overstimulated brains the thrill they craved, like the red cape of the matador. But such desirable victims had grown scarce. In Tsinghua there was probably only one left. Because he was so rare, he was reserved for the very end of the struggle session.
叶哲泰从文革开始一直活到了现在，并且一直处于第一阶段，他不认罪，不自杀，也不麻木。	Ye Zhetai had survived the Cultural Revolution so far, but he remained in the first mental stage. He refused to repent, to kill himself, or to become numb.
当这位物理学教授走上批判台时，他那神情分明在说：让我背负的十字架更沉重一些吧！	When this physics professor walked onto the stage in front of the crowd, his expression clearly said: Let the cross I bear be even heavier.
红卫兵们让他负担的东西确实很重，但不是十字架。	The Red Guards did indeed have him carry a burden, but it wasn't a cross.
别的批判对象戴的高帽子都是用竹条扎的框架，而他戴的这顶却是用一指粗的钢筋焊成的，还有他挂在胸前的那块牌子，也不是别人挂的木板，而是从实验室的一个烤箱上拆下的铁门，上面用黑色醒目地写着他的名字，并沿对角线画上了一个红色的大叉。	Other victims wore tall hats made from bamboo frames, but his was welded from thick steel bars. And the plaque he wore around his neck wasn't wooden, like the others, but an iron door taken from a laboratory oven. His name was written on the door in striking black characters, and two red diagonals were drawn across them in a large X.
押送叶哲泰上台的红卫兵比别的批判对象多了一倍，有六人，两男四女。	Twice the number of Red Guards used for other victims escorted Ye onto the stage: two men and four women.
两个男青年步伐稳健有力，一副成熟的青年布尔什维克形象，他们都是物理系理论物理专业大四年级的，叶哲泰曾是他们的老师；那四名女孩子要年轻得多，都是大学附中的初二学生，这些穿着军装扎着武装带的小战士挟带着逼人的青春活力，像四团绿色的火焰包围着叶哲泰。	The two young men strode with confidence and purpose, the very image of mature Bolshevik youths. They were both fourth-year students majoring in theoretical physics, and Ye was their professor. The women, really girls, were much younger, second-year students from the junior high school attached to the university. Dressed in military uniforms and equipped with bandoliers, they exuded youthful vigor and surrounded Ye Zhetai like four green flames.
叶哲泰的出现使下面的人群兴奋起来，刚才已有些乏力的口号声又像新一轮海潮般重新高昂起来，淹没了一切。	His appearance excited the crowd. The shouting of slogans, which had slackened a bit, now picked up with renewed force and drowned out everything else like a resurgent tide.
耐心地等口号声平息下去后，台上两名男红卫兵中的一人转向批判对象：“叶哲泰，你精通各种力学，应该看到自己正在抗拒的这股伟大的合力是多么强大，顽固下去是死路一条！	After waiting patiently for the noise to subside, one of the male Red Guards turned to the victim. "Ye Zhetai, you are an expert in mechanics. You should see how strong the great unified force you're resisting is. To remain so stubborn will lead only to your death!
今天继续上次大会的议程，废话就不多说了。	Today, we will continue the agenda from the last time. There's no need to waste words.
老实回答下面的问题：在六二至六五届的基础课中，你是不是擅自加入了大量的相对论内容？！”	Answer the following question without your typical deceit: Between the years of 1962 and 1965, did you not decide on your own to add relativity to the intro physics course?"
“相对论已经成为物理学的古典理论，基础课怎么能不涉及它呢？” 叶哲泰回答说。	"Relativity is part of the fundamental theories of physics," Ye answered. "How can a basic survey course not teach it?"
“你胡说！” 旁边的一名女红卫兵厉声说，“爱因斯坦是反动的学术权威，他有奶便是娘，跑去为美帝国主义造原子弹！	"You lie!" a female Red Guard by his side shouted. "Einstein is a reactionary academic authority. He would serve any master who dangled money in front of him. He even went to the American Imperialists and helped them build the atom bomb!
要建立起革命的科学，就要打倒以相对论为代表的资产阶级理论黑旗！”	To develop a revolutionary science, we must overthrow the black banner of capitalism represented by the theory of relativity!"
叶哲泰沉默着，他在忍受着头上铁高帽和胸前铁板带来的痛苦，不值得回应的问题就沉默了。	Ye remained silent. Enduring the pain brought by the heavy iron hat and the iron plaque hanging from his neck, he had no energy to answer questions that were not worth answering.
在他身后，他的学生也微微皱了一下眉头。	Behind him, one of his students also frowned.
说话的女孩儿是这四个中学红卫兵中天资最聪颖的一个，并且显然有备而来，刚才上台前还看到她在背批判稿，但要对付叶哲泰，仅凭她那几句口号是不行的。	The girl who had spoken was the most intelligent of the four female Red Guards, and she was clearly prepared, as she had been seen memorizing the struggle session script before coming onstage. But against someone like Ye Zhetai, a few slogans like that were insufficient.
他们决定亮出今天为老师准备的新武器，其中的一人对台下挥了一下手。	The Red Guards decided to bring out the new weapon they had prepared against their teacher. One of them waved to someone offstage.
叶哲泰的妻子，同系的物理学教授绍琳从台下的前排站起来，走上台。 她身穿一件很不合体的草绿色衣服，显然想与红卫兵的色彩拉近距离，但熟悉绍琳的人联想到以前常穿精致旗袍讲课的她，总觉得别扭。	Ye's wife, physics professor Shao Lin, stood up from the crowd's front row. She walked onto the stage dressed in an ill-fitting green outfit, clearly intended to imitate the military uniform of the Red Guards. Those who knew her remembered that she had often taught class in an elegant qipao, and her current appearance felt forced and awkward.
“叶哲泰！”	"Ye Zhetai!"
绍琳指着丈夫喝道，她显然不习惯于这种场合，尽量拔高自己的声音，却连其中的颤抖也放大了，“你没有想到我会站出来揭发你，批判你吧！？	She was clearly unused to such theater, and though she tried to make her voice louder, the effort magnified the tremors in it. "You didn't think I would stand up and expose you, criticize you?
是的，我以前受你欺骗，你用自己那反动的世界观和科学观蒙蔽了我！	Yes, in the past, I was fooled by you. You covered my eyes with your reactionary view of the world and science!
现在我醒悟了，在革命小将的帮助下，我要站到革命的一边，人民的一边！”	But now I am awake and alert. With the help of the revolutionary youths, I want to stand on the side of the revolution, the side of the people!"
她转向台下，“同志们、革命小将们、革命的教职员工们，我们应该认清爱因斯坦相对论的反动本质，这种本质，广义相对论体现得最清楚：它提出的静态宇宙模型，否定了物质的运动本性，是反辩证法的！	She turned to face the crowd. "Comrades, revolutionary youths, revolutionary faculty and staff, we must clearly understand the reactionary nature of Einstein's theory of relativity. This is most apparent in general relativity: Its static model of the universe negates the dynamic nature of matter. It is anti-dialectical!
它认为宇宙有限，更是彻头彻尾的反动唯心主义……”	It treats the universe as limited, which is absolutely a form of reactionary idealism...."
听着妻子滔滔不绝的演讲，叶哲泰苦笑了一下。	As he listened to his wife's lecture, Ye allowed himself a wry smile.
琳，我蒙蔽了你？	Lin, I fooled you?
其实你在我心中倒一直是个谜。	Indeed, in my heart you've always been a mystery.
一次，我对你父亲称赞你那过人的天资——他很幸运，去得早，躲过了这场灾难——老人家摇摇头，说我女儿不可能在学术上有什么建树；接着，他说出了对我后半生很重要的一句话：琳琳太聪明了，可是搞基础理论，不笨不行啊。	One time, I praised your genius to your father—he's lucky to have died early and escaped this catastrophe—and he shook his head, telling me that he did not think you would ever achieve much academically. What he said next turned out to be so important to the second half of my life: "Lin Lin is too smart. To work in fundamental theory, one must be stupid."
以后的许多年里，我不断悟出这话的深意。	In later years, I began to understand his words more and more.
琳，你真的太聪明了，早在几年前，你就嗅出了知识界的政治风向，做出了一些超前的举动，比如你在教学中，把大部分物理定律和参数都改了名字，欧姆定律改叫电阻定律，麦克斯韦方程改名成电磁方程，普朗克常数叫成了量子常数……	Lin, you truly are too smart. Even a few years ago, you could feel the political winds shifting in academia and prepared yourself. For example, when you taught, you changed the names of many physical laws and constants: Ohm's law you called resistance law, Maxwell's equations you called electromagnetic equations, Planck's constant you called the quantum constant....
你对学生们解释说：所有的科学成果都是广大劳动人民智慧的结晶，那些资产阶级学术权威不过是窃取了这些智慧。	You explained to your students that all scientific accomplishments resulted from the wisdom of the working masses, and those capitalist academic authorities only stole these fruits and put their names on them.
但即使这样，你仍然没有被“革命主流”所接纳，看看现在的你，衣袖上没有“革命教职员工”都戴着的红袖章；你两手空空地上来，连一本语录都没资格拿……	But even so, you couldn't be accepted by the revolutionary mainstream. Look at you now: You're not allowed to wear the red armband of the "revolutionary faculty and staff"; you had to come up here empty-handed, without the status to carry a Little Red Book....
谁让你出生在旧中国那样一个显赫的家庭，你父母又都是那么著名的学者。	You can't overcome the fault of being born to a prominent family in pre-revolutionary China and of having such famous scholars as parents.
说起爱因斯坦，你比我有更多的东西需要交待。	But you actually have more to confess about Einstein than I do.
1922年冬天，爱因斯坦到上海访问，你父亲因德语很好被安排为接待陪同者之一。	In the winter of 1922, Einstein visited Shanghai. Because your father spoke fluent German, he was asked to accompany Einstein on his tour.
你多次告诉我，父亲是在爱因斯坦的亲自教诲下走上物理学之路的，而你选择物理专业又是受了父亲的影响，所以爱翁也可以看作你的间接导师，你为此感到无比的自豪和幸福。	You told me many times that your father went into physics because of Einstein's encouragement, and you chose physics because of your father's influence. So, in a way, Einstein can be said to have indirectly been your teacher. And you once felt so proud and lucky to have such a connection.
后来我知道，父亲对你讲了善意的谎言，他与爱因斯坦只有过一次短得不能再短的交流。	Later, I found out that your father had told you a white lie. He and Einstein had only one very brief conversation.
那是l922年11月l3日上午，他陪爱因斯坦到南京路散步，同行的好像还有上海大学校长于右任、《大公报》经理曹谷冰等人，经过一个路基维修点，爱因斯坦在一名砸石子的小工身旁停下，默默看着这个在寒风中衣衫破烂、手脸污黑的男孩子，问你父亲：他一天挣多少钱？	The morning of November 13, 1922, he accompanied Einstein on a walk along Nanjing Road. Others who went on the walk included Yu Youren, president of Shanghai University, and Cao Gubing, general manager of the newspaper Ta Kung Pao. When they passed a maintenance site in the road bed, Einstein stopped next to a worker who was smashing stones and silently observed this boy with torn clothes and dirty face and hands. He asked your father how much the boy earned each day.
问过小工后，你父亲回答：五分。	After asking the boy, he told Einstein: five cents.
这就是他与改变世界的科学大师唯一的一次交流，没有物理学，没有相对论，只有冰冷的现实。	This was the only time he spoke with the great scientist who changed the world. There was no discussion of physics, of relativity, only cold, harsh reality.
据你父亲说，爱因斯坦听到他的回答后又默默地站在那里好一会儿，看着小工麻木的劳作，手里的烟斗都灭了也没有吸一口。	According to your father, Einstein stood there for a long time after hearing the answer, watching the boy's mechanical movements, not even bothering to smoke his pipe as the embers went out.
你父亲在回忆这件事后，对我发出这样的感叹：在中国，任何超脱飞扬的思想都会砰然坠地的，现实的引力太沉重了。	After your father recounted this memory to me, he sighed and said, "In China, any idea that dared to take flight would only crash back to the ground. The gravity of reality is too strong."
“低下头！” 一名男红卫兵大声命令。	"Lower your head!" one of the male Red Guards shouted.
这也许是自己的学生对老师一丝残存的同情，被批斗者都要低头，但叶哲泰要这样，那顶沉重的铁高帽就会掉下去，以后只要他一直低着头，就没有理由再给他戴上。	This may actually have been a gesture of mercy from his former student. All victims being struggled against were supposed to lower their heads. If Ye did lower his head, the tall, heavy iron hat would fall off, and if he kept his head lowered, there would be no reason to put it back on him.
但叶哲泰仍昂着头，用瘦弱的脖颈支撑着那束沉重的钢铁。	But Ye refused and held his head high, supporting the heavy weight with his thin neck.
“低头！ 你个反动顽固分子！ ！”	"Lower your head, you stubborn reactionary!"
旁边一名女红卫兵解下腰间的皮带朝叶哲泰挥去，黄铜带扣正打在他脑门上，在那里精确地留下了带扣的形状，但很快又被淤血模糊成黑紫的一团。	One of the girl Red Guards took off her belt and swung it at Ye. The copper belt buckle struck his forehead and left a clear impression that was quickly blurred by oozing blood.
他摇晃了一下，又站稳了。	He swayed unsteadily for a few moments, then stood straight and firm again.
一名男红卫兵质问叶哲泰：“在量子力学的教学中，你也散布过大量的反动言论！”	One of the male Red Guards said, "When you taught quantum mechanics, you also mixed in many reactionary ideas."
说完对绍琳点点头，示意她继续。	Then he nodded at Shao Lin, indicating that she should continue.
绍琳迫不及待地要继续下去了，她必须不停顿地说下去，以维持自己那摇摇欲坠的精神免于彻底垮掉。	Shao was happy to oblige. She had to keep on talking, otherwise her fragile mind, already hanging on only by a thin thread, would collapse completely.
“叶哲泰，这一点你是无法抵赖的！	"Ye Zhetai, you cannot deny this charge!
你多次向学生散布反动的哥本哈根解释！”	You have often lectured students on the reactionary Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics."
“这毕竟是目前公认的最符合实验结果的解释。”	"It is, after all, the explanation recognized to be most in line with experimental results."
叶哲泰说，在受到如此重击后，他的口气还如此从容，这让绍琳很吃惊，也很恐惧。	His tone, so calm and collected, surprised and frightened Shao Lin.
“这个解释认为，是外部的观察导致了量子波函数的坍缩，这是反动唯心论的另一种表现形式，而且是一种最猖狂的表现！”	"This explanation posits that external observation leads to the collapse of the quantum wave function. This is another expression of reactionary idealism, and it's indeed the most brazen expression."
“是哲学指引实验还是实验指引哲学？”	"Should philosophy guide experiments, or should experiments guide philosophy?"
叶哲泰问道，他这突然的反击令批判者们一时不知所措。	Ye's sudden counterattack shocked those leading the struggle session. For a moment they did not know what to do.
“当然是正确的马克思主义哲学指引科学实验！” 一名男红卫兵说。	"Of course it should be the correct philosophy of Marxism that guides scientific experiments!" one of the male Red Guards finally said.
“这等于说正确的哲学是从天上掉下来的。	"Then that's equivalent to saying that the correct philosophy falls out of the sky.
这反对实践出真知，恰恰是违背马克思主义对自然界的认知原则的。”	This is against the idea that the truth emerges from experience. It's counter to the principles of how Marxism seeks to understand nature."
绍琳和两名大学红卫兵无言以对，与中学和社会上的红卫兵不同，他们不可能一点儿道理也不讲。	Shao Lin and the two college student Red Guards had no answer for this. Unlike the Red Guards who were still in junior high school, they couldn't completely ignore logic.
但来自附中的四位小将自有她们“无坚不摧”的革命方式，刚才动手的那个女孩儿又狠抽了叶哲泰一皮带，另外三个女孩子也都分别抡起皮带抽了一下，当同伴革命时，她们必须表现得更革命，至少要同样革命。	But the four junior high girls had their own revolutionary methods that they believed were invincible. The girl who had hit Ye before took out her belt and whipped Ye again. The other three girls also took off their belts to strike at Ye. With their companion displaying such revolutionary fervor, they had to display even more, or at least the same amount.
两名男红卫兵没有过问，他们要是现在管这事，也有不革命的嫌疑。	The two male Red Guards didn't interfere. If they tried to intervene now, they would be suspected of being insufficiently revolutionary.
“你还在教学中散布宇宙大爆炸理论，这是所有科学理论中最反动的一个！”	"You also taught the big bang theory. This is the most reactionary of all scientific theories."
一名男红卫兵试图转移话题。	One of the male Red Guards spoke up, trying to change the subject.
“也许以后这个理论会被推翻，但本世纪的两大宇宙学发现：哈勃红移和3K宇宙背景辐射，使大爆炸学说成为目前为止最可信的宇宙起源理论。”	"Maybe in the future this theory will be disproven. But two great cosmological discoveries of this century— Hubble's law, and observation of the cosmic microwave background–show that the big bang theory is currently the most plausible explanation for the origin of the universe."
“胡说！”	"Lies!"
绍琳大叫起来，又接着滔滔不绝地讲起了宇宙大爆炸，自然不忘深刻地剖析其反动本质。	Shao Lin shouted. Then she began a long lecture about the big bang theory, remembering to splice in insightful critiques of the theory's extremely reactionary nature.
但这理论的超级新奇吸引了四个小女孩儿中最聪明的那一个，她不由自主地问道：“连时间都是从那个奇点开始的！？	But the freshness of the theory attracted the most intelligent of the four girls, who couldn't help but ask, "Time began with the singularity?
那奇点以前有什么？”	So what was there before the singularity?"
“什么都没有。” 叶哲泰说，像回答任何一个小女孩儿的问题那样，他转头慈祥地看着她，铁高帽和已受的重伤，使他这动作很艰难。	"Nothing," Ye said, the way he would answer a question from any curious young person. He turned to look at the girl kindly. With his injuries and the tall iron hat, the motion was very difficult.
“什么…… 都没有？！	"No ... nothing?
反动！	That's reactionary!
反动透顶！ ！” 那女孩儿惊恐万状地大叫起来，她不知所措地转向绍琳寻求帮助，立刻得到了回应。	Completely reactionary!" the frightened girl shouted. She turned to Shao Lin, who gladly came to her aid.
“这给上帝的存在留下了位置。”	"The theory leaves open a place to be filled by God."
绍琳对女孩儿点点头提示说。	Shao nodded at the girl.
小红卫兵那茫然的思路立刻找到了立脚点，她举起紧握皮带的手指着叶哲泰，“你，是想说有上帝？！”	The young Red Guard, confused by these new thoughts, finally found her footing. She raised her hand, still holding the belt, and pointed at Ye. "You: you're trying to say that God exists?"
“我不知道。”	"I don't know."
“你说什么！”	"What?"
“我是说不知道，如果上帝是指宇宙之外的超意识的话，我不知道它是不是存在；正反两方面，科学都没给出确实的证据。”	"I'm saying I don't know. If by 'God' you mean some kind of superconsciousness outside the universe, I don't know if it exists or not. Science has given no evidence either way."
其实，在这噩梦般的时刻，叶哲泰已倾向于相信它不存在了。	Actually, in this nightmarish moment, Ye was leaning toward believing that God did not exist.
这句大逆不道的话在整个会场引起了骚动，在台上一名红卫兵的带领下，又爆发了一波波的口号声。	This extremely reactionary statement caused a commotion in the crowd. Led by one of the Red Guards on stage, another tide of slogan-shouting exploded.
“打倒反动学术权威叶哲泰！！”	"Down with reactionary academic authority Ye Zhetai!"
“打倒一切反动学术权威！！”	"Down with all reactionary academic authorities!"
“打倒一切反动学说！！” ……	"Down with all reactionary doctrines!"
“上帝是不存在的，一切宗教，都是统治阶级编造出来的麻痹人民的精神工具！” 口号平息后，那个小女孩儿大声说。	Once the slogans died down, the girl shouted, "God does not exist. All religions are tools concocted by the ruling class to paralyze the spirit of the people!"
“这种看法是片面的。” 叶哲泰平静地说。	"That is a very one-sided view," Ye said calmly.
恼羞成怒的小红卫兵立刻做出了判断，对于眼前这个危险的敌人，一切语言都无意义了。	The young Red Guard, embarrassed and angry, reached the conclusion that, against this dangerous enemy, all talk was useless.
她抡起皮带冲上去，她的三个小同志立刻跟上。	She picked up her belt and rushed at Ye, and her three companions followed.
叶哲泰的个子很高，这四个十四岁的女孩儿只能朝上抡皮带才能打到他那不肯低下的头。	Ye was tall, and the four fourteen-year-olds had to swing their belts upward to reach his head, still held high.
在开始的几下打击后，他头上能起一定保护作用的铁高帽被打掉了，接下来带铜扣的宽皮带如雨点般打在他的头上和身上——他终于倒下了。	After a few strikes, the tall iron hat, which had protected him a little, fell off. The continuing barrage of strikes by the metal buckles finally made him fall down.
这鼓舞了小红卫兵们，她们更加投入地继续着这“崇高”的战斗，她们在为信念而战，为理想而战，她们为历史给予自己的光辉使命所陶醉，为自己的英勇而自豪……	The young Red Guards, encouraged by their success, became even more devoted to this glorious struggle. They were fighting for faith, for ideals. They were intoxicated by the bright light cast on them by history, proud of their own bravery....
“最高指示：要文斗不要武斗！” 叶哲泰的两名学生终于下定了决心，喊出了这句话，两人同时冲过去，拉开了已处于半疯狂状态的四个小女孩儿。	Ye's two students had finally had enough. "The chairman instructed us to 'rely on eloquence rather than violence'!" They rushed over and pulled the four semicrazed girls off Ye.
但已经晚了，物理学家静静地躺在地上，半睁的双眼看着从他的头颅上流出的血迹，疯狂的会场瞬间陷入了一片死寂。	But it was already too late. The physicist lay quietly on the ground, his eyes still open as blood oozed from his head. The frenzied crowd sank into silence.
那条血迹是唯一在动的东西，它像一条红蛇缓慢地蜿蜒爬行着，到达台沿后一滴滴地滴在下面一个空箱子上，发出有节奏的“哒哒”声，像渐行渐远的脚步。	The only thing that moved was a thin stream of blood. Like a red snake, it slowly meandered across the stage, reached the edge, and dripped onto a chest below. The rhythmic sound made by the blood drops was like the steps of someone walking away.
一阵怪笑声打破了寂静，这声音是精神已彻底崩溃的绍琳发出的，听起来十分恐怖。 人们开始离去，最后发展成一场大溃逃，每个人想都尽快逃离这个地方。	A cackling laugh broke the silence. The sound came from Shao Lin, whose mind had finally broken. The laughter frightened the attendees, who began to leave the struggle session, first in trickles, and then in a flood.
会场很快空了下来，只剩下一个姑娘站在台下。	The exercise grounds soon emptied, leaving only one young woman below the stage.
她是叶哲泰的女儿叶文洁。	She was Ye Wenjie, Ye Zhetai's daughter.
当那四个女孩儿施暴夺去父亲生命时，她曾想冲上台去，但身边的两名老校工死死抓住她，并在耳边低声告诉她别连自己的命也不要了，当时会场已经处于彻底的癫狂，她的出现只会引出更多的暴徒。	As the four girls were taking her father's life, she had tried to rush onto the stage. But two old university janitors held her down and whispered into her ear that she would lose her own life if she went. The mass struggle session had turned into a scene of madness, and her appearance would only incite more violence.
她曾声嘶力竭地哭叫，但声音淹没在会场上疯狂的口号和助威声中，当一切寂静下来时，她自己也发不出任何声音了，只是凝视台上父亲已没有生命的躯体，那没有哭出和喊出的东西在她的血液中弥漫、溶解，将伴她一生。	She had screamed and screamed, but she had been drowned out by the frenzied waves of slogans and cheers. When it was finally quiet again, she was no longer capable of making any sound. She stared at her father's lifeless body, and the thoughts she could not voice dissolved into her blood, where they would stay with her for the rest of her life.
人群散去后，她站在那里，身体和四肢仍保持着老校工抓着她时的姿态，一动不动，像石化了一般。	After the crowd dispersed, she remained like a stone statue, her body and limbs in the positions they were in when the two old janitors had held her back.
过了好久，她才将悬空的手臂放下来，缓缓起身走上台，坐在父亲的遗体边，握起他的一只已凉下来的手，两眼失神地看着远方。	After a long time, she finally let her arms down, walked slowly onto the stage, sat next to her father's body, and held one of his already-cold hands, her eyes staring emptily into the distance.
当遗体要被抬走时，叶文洁从衣袋中拿出一样东西放到父亲的那只手中，那是父亲的烟斗。	When they finally came to carry away the body, she took something from her pocket and put it into her father's hand: his pipe.
文洁默默地离开了已经空无一人一片狼藉的操场，走上回家的路。	Wenjie quietly left the exercise grounds, empty save for the trash left by the crowd, and headed home.
当她走到教工宿舍楼下时，听到了从二楼自家窗口传出的一阵阵痴笑声，这声音是那个她曾叫做妈妈的女人发出的。	When she reached the foot of the faculty housing apartment building, she heard peals of crazy laughter coming out of the second-floor window of her home. That was the woman she had once called mother.
文洁默默地转身走去，任双脚将她带向别处。	Wenjie turned around, not caring where her feet would carry her.
她最后发现自己来到了阮雯的家门前。	Finally, she found herself at the door of Professor Ruan Wen.
在大学四年中，阮老师一直是她的班主任，也是她最亲密的朋友。	Throughout the four years of Wenjie's college life, Professor Ruan had been her advisor and her closest friend.
在叶文洁读天体物理专业研究生的两年里，再到后来停课闹革命至今，阮老师一直是她除父亲外最亲近的人。	During the two years after that, when Wenjie had been a graduate student in the Astrophysics Department, and through the subsequent chaos of the Cultural Revolution, Professor Ruan remained her closest confidante, other than her father.
阮雯曾留学剑桥，她的家曾对叶文洁充满了吸引力，那里有许多从欧洲带回来的精致的书籍、油画和唱片，一架钢琴；还有一排放在精致小木架上的欧式烟斗，父亲那只就是她送的，这些烟斗有地中海石楠根的，有土耳其海泡石的，每一个都仿佛浸透了曾将它们拿在手中和含在嘴里深思的那个男人的智慧，但阮雯从未提起过他。	Ruan had studied at Cambridge University, and her home had once fascinated Wenjie: refined books, paintings, and records brought back from Europe; a piano; a set of European-style pipes arranged on a delicate wooden stand, some made from Mediterranean briar, some from Turkish meerschaum. Each of them seemed suffused with the wisdom of the man who had once held the bowl in his hand or clamped the stem between his teeth, deep in thought, though Ruan had never mentioned the man's name. The pipe that had belonged to Wenjie's father had in fact been a gift from Ruan.
这个雅致温暖的小世界成为文洁逃避尘世风暴的港湾。 但那是阮雯的家被抄之前的事，她在运动中受到的冲击和文洁父亲一样重。	This elegant, warm home had once been a safe harbor for Wenjie when she needed to escape the storms of the larger world, but that was before Ruan's home had been searched and her possessions seized by the Red Guards. Like Wenjie's father, Ruan had suffered greatly during the Cultural Revolution.
在批斗会上，红卫兵把高跟鞋挂到她脖子上，用口红在她的脸上划出许多道子，以展示她那腐朽的资产阶级生活方式。	During her struggle sessions, the Red Guards had hung a pair of high heels around her neck and streaked her face with lipstick to show how she had lived the corrupt lifestyle of a capitalist.
叶文洁推开阮雯的家门，发现抄家后混乱的房间变得整洁了，那几幅被撕的油画又贴糊好挂在墙上，歪倒的钢琴也端正地立在原位，虽然已被砸坏不能弹了，但还是擦得很干净，残存的几本精装书籍也被整齐地放回书架上……	Wenjie pushed open the door to Ruan's home, and she saw that the chaos left by the Red Guards had been cleaned up: The torn oil paintings had been glued back together and rehung on the walls; the toppled piano had been set upright and wiped clean, though it was broken and could no longer be played; the few books left behind had been put back neatly on the shelf....
阮雯端坐在写字台前的那把转椅上，安详地闭着双眼。	Ruan was sitting on the chair before her desk, her eyes closed.
叶文洁站在她身边，摸摸她的额头、脸和手，都是冰凉的，其实文洁在进门后就注意到了写字台上倒放着的那个已空的安眠药瓶。	Wenjie stood next to Ruan and gently caressed her professor's forehead, face, and hands—all cold. Wenjie had noticed the empty sleeping pill bottle on the desk as soon as she came in.
她默默地站了一会儿，转身走去，悲伤已感觉不到了，她现在就像一台盖革计数仪，当置身于超量的辐射中时，反而不再有任何反应，没有声响，读数为零。	She stood there for a while, silent. Then she turned and walked away. She could no longer feel grief. She was now like a Geiger counter that had been subjected to too much radiation, no longer capable of giving any reaction, noiselessly displaying a reading of zero.
但当她就要出门时，还是回过头来最后看了阮雯一眼，她发现阮老师很好地上了妆，她抹了口红，也穿上了高跟鞋。	But as she was about to leave Ruan's home, Wenjie turned around for a final look. She noticed that Professor Ruan had put on makeup. She was wearing a light coat of lipstick and a pair of high heels.
