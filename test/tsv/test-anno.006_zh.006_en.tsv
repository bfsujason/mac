海老公问起今日做了什么事，韦小宝说了到鳌拜家中抄家，至于吞没珍宝、金银、匕首等事，自然绝口不提，最后道：“太后命我到鳌拜家里拿两部《四十二章经》……”	When Old Hai asked what he had been doing that day, Trinket told him that he had been helping supervise the confiscation of Oboi's estate. He concluded his account—which of course omitted any mention of the dagger and various other valuables that he had pocketed for himself—by telling him about the two copies of the Sutra in Forty-Two Sections that had been discovered in Oboi's house.
海老公突然站起，问道：“鳌拜家有两部《四十二章经》？”	The old eunuch jumped up in surprise. 'Did you say there were two copies at Oboi's place?'
韦小宝道：“是啊。	'Yes,' said Trinket.
是太后和皇上吩咐去取的，否则的话，我拿来给了你，别人也未必知道。”	'We were told to look for them by the Empress Dowager; otherwise I could have brought them to you without anyone knowing.'
海老公脸色阴沉，哼了一声，冷冷的道：“落入了太后手里啦，很好，很好！”	Old Hai's face fell, but he soon recovered his composure. 'Hm, in the Empress Dowager's hands now, are they?' he said grimly. 'Well, it could be worse.'
待会厨房中送了饭来，海老公只吃了小半碗便不吃了，翻着一双无神的白眼，仰起了头只是想心事。	Shortly after this their evening meal was brought in from the Imperial kitchens. After eating barely half a bowl of rice, the old eunuch sat back, turned up his pale, unseeing eyes towards the ceiling, and appeared to be lost in thought.
韦小宝吃完饭，心想我先睡一会，到三更时分再去和那小宫女说话玩儿，见海老公呆呆的坐着不动，便和衣上床而睡。	When he had finished his own meal, Trinket decided to get a little sleep in before going to his midnight assignation with the maid-in-waiting. Not wishing to disturb the old eunuch, who was still sitting motionless in his chair, he slipped over to his bed, lay down on it fully clothed, and was soon asleep.
他迷迷糊糊的睡了一会，悄悄起身，把那盒蜜饯糕饼揣在怀里，生怕惊醒海老公，慢慢一步步的蹑足而出，走到门边，轻轻拔开了门闩，再轻轻打开了一扇门，突然听得海老公问道：“小桂子，你去哪里？”	After sleeping fitfully for what must have been several hours, he got up silently, stuffed the box of cakes inside his breast pocket,and made his way on tiptoe across the room, pausing at each step for fear the old eunuch might waken. Then, slowly and gently, he slid back the door-bar and opened one of the leaves of the door. At that very moment he heard the old eunuch's voice calling out from behind him. 'Laurie, where are you going?'
韦小宝一惊，说道：“我…… 我小便去。”	'I'm . . . I'm going out for a piss.'
海老公道：“干么不在屋里小便？”	'Why can't you piss in the pot?'
韦小宝道：“我睡不着，到花园里走走。”	'I can't get to sleep,' said Trinket. 'I thought I'd walk around in the garden for a bit.'
生怕海老公阻拦，也不多说，拔步往外便走，左足刚踏出一步，只觉后领一紧，已给海老公抓住，提了回来。	No point in standing there talking, he thought; better get off quickly, before the Old Devil could stop him. But just as his foot crossed the threshold, he felt a tightening around the throat. 'Ow!' he hollered. The old eunuch had him by the collar and was propelling him back into the room.
韦小宝“啊”的一声，尖叫了出来，当下便有个念头：“糟糕，糟糕，老乌龟知道我要去见那小宫女，不许我去。” 念头还未转完，已给海老公摔在床上。	'Ow!' he hollered. The old eunuch had him by the collar and was propelling him back into the room. 'Damn!' thought Trinket, 'Damn!' as the old man threw him down on the bed. 'The Old Devil knows I want to go and see that little maid and now he's going to stop me.'
韦小宝笑道：“公公，你试我武功么？	'Is this to test my reactions, Goong-goong?' he said, forcing a laugh.
好几天没教我功夫了，这一抓是什么招式？”	'It's a long time since you've taught me any kungfu. What do you call that grip?'
海老公哼了一声，道：“这叫做‘瓮中抓鳖’，手到擒来。	'Catching a Turtle in a Jar, ' said the old eunuch.
鳖便是甲鱼，捉你这只小甲鱼。”	'Little turtle!'
韦小宝心道：“老甲鱼捉小甲鱼！” 可是毕竟不敢说出口，眼珠骨溜溜的乱转，寻思脱身之计。 海老公坐在他床沿上，轻轻的道：“你胆大心细，聪明伶俐，学武虽然不肯踏实，但如果由我来好好琢磨琢磨，也可以算得是可造之材，可惜啊可惜。”	'Turtle yourself!' thought Trinket, but didn't dare say it out loud. His eyes were darting all round him, looking for some means of escape; but the old eunuch sat himself down beside him on the bed and began addressing him in a low, almost mournful voice. 'You're bold but not careless,' he said. 'You're a sharp, intelligent lad. You haven't shown much willingness to exert yourself, but if I could have taken you in hand and knocked you into some sort of shape, you might have made quite a promising little fighter. It seems such a pity.'
韦小宝问道：“公公，可惜什么？”	'What does, Goong-goong?' Trinket asked. 'What seems a pity?'
海老公不答，只叹了口气，过了半晌，说道：“你的京片子学得也差不多了。	The old eunuch ignored his question and heaved a sigh. After a pause he said: 'Your Peking accent is almost perfect now.
几个月之前，倘若就会说这样的话，不带丝毫扬州腔调，倒也不容易发觉。”	If your voice had sounded like this a few months ago, without a trace of the Yangzhou twang in it, I might have been taken in.'
韦小宝大吃一惊，霎时之间全身寒毛直竖，忍不住身子发抖，牙关轻轻相击，强笑道：“公公，你…… 你今儿晚上的说话，真是…… 嘻嘻…… 真是奇怪。”	Shock raised the fine hairs on Trinket's body. An uncontrollable shivering took possession of him and his teeth began chattering. Nevertheless he managed a nervous laugh. 'G-g-goong-goong, you're speaking very—ha ha!—s-strangely tonight.'
海老公又叹了口气，问道：“孩子，你今年几岁啦？”	The old eunuch heaved another sigh. 'How old are you, child?'
韦小宝听他语气甚和，惊惧之情渐减，道：“我…… 我是十四岁罢。”	He was speaking so calmly that Trinket's terror was somewhat allayed. 'About fourteen, I think.'
海老公道：“十三岁就十三岁，十四岁就十四岁，为什么是‘十四岁罢？’”	'If you're thirteen, you're thirteen; if you're fourteen, you're fourteen. What do you mean, you "think"?'
韦小宝道：“我妈妈也记不大清楚，我自己可不知道。”	'My mother's not sure herself,' said Trinket. 'I can't say exactly.'
这一句倒是真话，他妈妈胡里胡涂，小宝到底几岁，向来说不大准。	This was true. His mother had always been vague when asked about his age.
海老公点了点头，咳嗽了几声，道：“前几年练功夫，练得走了火，惹上了这咳嗽的毛病，越咳越厉害，近年来自己知道是不大成的了。”	The old eunuch nodded and coughed for a bit. 'A few years ago I overtaxed my body in some way while I was training. It brought on this cough which just seems to get worse and worse. This last year I've begun to realize there's no hope for me.'
韦小宝道：“我…… 我觉得你近来…… 近来咳得好了些。”	'Oh, I don't know,' said Trinket, not quite sure where this conversation was heading. 'I thought your cough was getting a bit better lately.'
海老公摇头道：“好什么？	'Better?' said the old eunuch shaking his head.
一点也没好。	'It's not the least bit better.
我胸口痛得好厉害，你又怎知道？”	I've got a terrible pain in my chest all the time. What would you know about it?'
韦小宝道：“现下怎样？	'What's it like at the moment?' said Trinket.
要不要我拿些药给你吃？”	'Would you like me to get you some of your medicine?'
海老公叹道：“眼睛瞧不见，药是不能乱服的了。”	Again the old man sighed. 'I've already lost my eyesight. Medicine has to be taken in the proper doses.'
韦小宝大气也不敢透，不知他说这些话是什么用意。	Trinket almost stopped breathing. Did this mean that the Old Devil had guessed about that as well?
海老公又道：“你机缘挺好，巴结上了皇上，本来嘛，也可以有一番大大的作为。	'You've got a lucky streak,' the old eunuch continued. 'Getting yourself into the Emperor's graces like that—it could have been very useful.
你没净身，我给你净了也不打紧，只不过，唉，迟了，迟了。”	You haven't been purified, of course, but that's no problem. I could have done the cutting for you. Ah, it's a pity. Too late. Just too late.'
韦小宝不懂“净身”是什么意思，只觉他今晚话说的语气说不出的古怪，轻声道：“公公，很晚了，你这就睡罢。”	Trinket had no idea what 'purified' meant; but everything the old eunuch was saying tonight seemed to have something odd about it. 'Goong-goong,' he said, 'it's very late. Shouldn't you be getting some sleep?'
海老公道：“睡罢，睡罢！	'Sleep?' said the old eunuch. 'Sleep?
唉，睡觉的时候以后可多着呢，朝也睡，晚也睡，睡着了永远不醒。	There's plenty of sleeping to come: sleeping all day, sleeping all night, sleeping and never waking up again.
孩子，一个人老是睡觉，不用起身，不会心口痛，不会咳嗽得难过，那不是挺美么？”	No more getting up in the morning, no more pains in the chest, no more coughing. What do you think, boy? Don't you think it would be nice?'
韦小宝吓得不敢作声。	Trinket was too frightened to answer.
海老公道：“孩子，你家里还有些什么人？”	Tell me, boy,' said the old eunuch, 'who else is there besides you in your family?'
这平平淡淡一句问话，韦小宝却难以回答。	The question was straightforward enough and seemed to have been asked without sinister intent, yet Trinket did not know how to answer it.
他可不知那死了的小桂子家中有些什么人，胡乱回答，多半立时便露出马脚，但又不能不答，只盼海老公本来不知小桂子家中底细，才这样问，便道：“我家里只有个老娘，其余的人，这些年来，唉，那也不用提了。”	He hadn't the faintest idea what family the late Laurie had had and feared that almost any answer he gave was likely to betray his ignorance; yet he had to say something. He settled for a modified version of the truth, hoping that Old Hai himself knew nothing about Laurie's family. 'My mother's the only one at home,' he said. 'What's happened to the rest of the family during these past few years, I'd rather not say.'
话中拖上这样个尾巴，倘若小桂子还有父兄姊弟，就不妨用“那也不用提了”这六字来推搪。	
海老公道：“只有个老娘。	'Only a mother,' said the old eunuch.
你们福建话，叫娘是叫什么的？”	'And what word do you use for "mother" in the Fujian dialect?'
韦小宝又是一惊：“什么福建话？	Here was another surprise for Trinket.
莫非小桂子是福建人？	'Could the real Laurie have been a Fujianese?' he wondered.
他说我以前的说话中有扬州腔调，恐怕…… 恐怕…… 那么他眼睛给我弄瞎这回事，他知不知道？”	'I thought he said just now that I used to have a Yangzhou accent. Perhaps . . . perhaps he does know that I blinded him.'
刹那之间，心中转过了无数念头，含含糊糊的道：“这个…… 这个…… 你问这个干么？”	Some seconds elapsed while his brain raced through a number of possibilities. His final response was a lame one. 'I... I—why do you ask?'
海老公又叹了口气，说道：“你年纪小小，就这样坏，嘿，到底是像你爹呢，还是像你妈？”	There was another sigh from the old eunuch. 'So young and yet so wicked! I wonder where you get it from. Who do you most resemble, your father or your mother?'
韦小宝嘻嘻一笑，说道：“我是谁也不像。	'I don't think I'm like anyone,' said Trinket.
好是不大好，坏也不算挺坏。”	'Anyway, I'm not all that bad. I may not be very good, but I don't think I'm wicked.'
海老公咳了几声，道：“我是成年之后，才净身做太监的……”	'I haven't always been a eunuch,' the old man said after a few more coughs. 'I was already a grown man when I was purified.'
韦小宝暗暗叫苦：“原来做太监要净身，那就是割去小便的东西。	Trinket was horrified. 'So that's what being "purified" means: having your piss-pipe and the other bits cut off.
他说知道我没净身，要是来给我净身，那可乖乖龙的东……”	I hope he doesn't think he's going to purify me. Holy ding-a-ling dongs!'
只听海老公续道：“我本来有个儿子，只可惜在八岁那年就死了。	But the old man's thoughts were on another track. 'I had a son once,' he said. 'Unfortunately he died when he was only eight years old.
倘若活到今日，我的孙儿也该有你这般大了。	If he'd lived, I might have had a grandson today of about your age.
那个姓茅的茅十八，不是你爹爹罢？”	Tell me, is that Whiskers Mao your father?'
韦小宝颤声道：“不…… 不是！	'No. No, he's not.
辣块妈妈的，当…… 当然不是。”	Hot-piece momma, of course he's not!'
心中一急，扬州话冲口而出。	
海老公道：“我也想不是的。	'I didn't think he was,' said the old eunuch.
倘若你是我儿子，失陷在皇宫之中，就算有天大危险，我也会来救你出去。”	'If you were my son and you were trapped here in the Palace, I would find the means of getting you out somehow, whatever the danger.'
韦小宝苦笑道：“就可惜我没你这个好爹爹。”	Trinket forced a smile. 'Pity you're not my father,' he said. 'I could do with a nice, kind father like you.'
海老公道：“我教过你两套武功，第一套‘大擒拿手’，第二套‘大慈大悲千叶手’，这两套功夫，我都没教全，你自然也没学会，只学了这么一成半成，嘿嘿，嘿嘿。”	'Those two kinds of Martial Art I was teaching you, the Greater Catch-Can and the Merciful Guanyin,' said the old eunuch, '—I'd only started you on them: you couldn't be said to have more than a smattering of either.'
韦小宝道：“是啊，你老人家最好将这两套功夫教得我学全了。	'You ought to teach me them properly, Goong-goong,' said Trinket.
你这样天下第一的武功，总算有个人传了下来，给你老人家扬名，那才成话。”	'You're a world champion. You ought to have someone to carry on the tradition when you're gone. Teach me, so that one day I can make you famous: that's what you ought to do.'
海老公摇头道：“‘天下第一’四个字，哪里敢当？	The old man shook his head. 'I'm not a "world champion".
世上武功高强的，可不知有多少。	There are any number of kungfu Masters in the world as highly qualified as I am.
我这两套功夫，你这一生一世也来不及学得全了。”	In any case, you couldn't master my two kinds of kungfu if you spent a whole lifetime studying them.'
他顿了一顿，说道：“你吸一口气，摸到左边小腹，离开肚脐眼三寸之处，用力掀一掀，且看怎样？”	After a moment he said: 'Put your fingers on your belly about three inches to the left of your navel and press. Hard. Tell me what you feel.'
韦小宝依言摸到他所说之处，用力一掀，登时痛澈心肺，不由得“啊”的一声，大叫出来，霎时间满头大汗，不住喘气。	Trinket did as he said. A pain shot through his vitals, so intense that he cried out loud. He found himself panting, and the sweat stood out on his brow.
近半个多月来，左边小腹偶然也隐隐作痛，只道吃坏了肚子，何况只痛得片刻，便即止歇，从来没放在心上，不料对准了一点用力掀落，竟会痛得这等厉害。	As a matter of fact, for several weeks now he had from time to time been conscious of a slight pain in his left side which he put down to indigestion. Since it had invariably gone away after a bit, he had not paid it much attention. He had certainly never imagined that pressure on the source of this pain could produce such agony.
海老公阴恻恻的道：“很有趣罢？”	'Interesting, isn't it!' said the old eunuch with ill-disguised satisfaction.
韦小宝肚中大骂：“死老乌龟，臭老乌龟！”	Trinket cursed him inwardly: 'Hateful Old Devil! Stinking Old Turtle!'
说道：“有一点点痛，也没什么有趣。”	But all he said was: 'It hurts a bit. I wouldn't have said it was interesting exactly.'
海老公道：“你每天早上去赌钱，又去跟皇上练武，你还没回来，饭菜就送来了。	'Every morning when they deliver our food from the kitchens, you're still not back from gambling with your friends or wrestling with the Emperor, ' said the old eunuch.
我觉得这汤可不够鲜，每天从药箱之中，取了一瓶药出来，给你在汤里加上些料。	'I noticed some time ago that the soup they serve is in need of seasoning, so every day I've been getting out one of the little bottles from my medicine chest and tipping a little of the powder in the soup to give it a bit of flavour.
只加这么一点儿，加得多了，毒性太重，对你身子不大妥当。	Only a tiny bit. Too much of the poison would have too obvious an effect.
你这人是很细心的，可是我从来不喝汤，你一点也不疑心吗？”	A smart lad like you doesn't miss much; but as I had been careful never to take soup myself anyway, you didn't suspect anything.'
韦小宝毛骨悚然，道：“我…… 我以为你不爱喝汤。	Trinket could feel his skin crawling. 'But. . . but... I thought you didn't like soup,' he said.
你…… 你又说喝了汤，会…… 会…… 咳…… 咳嗽……”	'You said it made you cough.'
海老公道：“我本来很爱喝汤的，不过汤里有了毒药，虽然份量极轻，可是天天喝下去，时日久了，总有点危险，是不是？”	'I'm very fond of soup as a matter of fact,' said the old eunuch, 'but when the soup's poisoned, even if there's only a minute amount of poison in it, the effect of drinking it day after day could in the end become a little dangerous, don't you think?'
韦小宝愤然道：“是极，是极！	'I should say it could!' said Trinket indignantly.
公公，你当真厉害。”	'You think of everything, Goong-goong, don't you!'
海老公叹了口气，道：“也不见得。	'Oh, I don't know, ' said the old eunuch with a sigh.
本来我想让你再服三个月毒药，这才放你出宫，那时你就慢慢肚痛了。	'I'd originally been planning to let "you take the poison for about three months and then set you free so that it would have a nice long time to work on you.
先是每天痛半个时辰，痛得也不很凶，以后越痛越厉害，痛的时刻也越来越长，大概到一年以后，那便日夜不停的大痛，要痛到你将自己脑袋到墙上去狠狠的撞，痛得将自己手上、腿上的肉，一块块咬下来。”	To start with you'd just have about half-an-hour's pain every day, not very severe. Then, as time went by, it would get gradually worse and the periods when you felt it would get longer. After about a year you would be in pain continuously, night and day, and the pain would get so terrible that in the end you would be dashing your head against walls and tearing the flesh of your arms and legs with your teeth, '
说到这里，叹道：“可惜我身子越来越不成了，恐怕不能再等。	He sighed again. 'Unfortunately my health is getting so bad that I doubt if I can wait that long.
你身上中的毒，旁人没解药，我终究是有的。 小娃娃，你到底是受了谁的指使，想这计策来弄瞎我眼睛？	Now then, no one else has an antidote for this poison but me, so why don't you be a good little boy and tell me who you are working for? Who was it that put you up to blinding me?
你老实说了出来，我立刻给你解药。”	If you will give me an honest answer to that question, I promise to give you the antidote this minute. '
韦小宝年纪虽小，也知道就算自己说了指使之人出来，他也决不能饶了自己性命，何况根本就无人指使，说道：“指使之人自然有的，说出来只怕吓你一大跳。	The question was unanswerable because there was no such person; but Trinket, though young, was not so naive as to believe that the old eunuch would spare his life even if he answered it. 'The person I'm working for?' he said. 'You'd get a nasty shock if I told you.
原来你早知道我不是小桂子，想了这个法子来折磨我，哈哈，哈哈，你这可上了我的大当啦！ 哈哈，哈哈！”	So you knew all along that I wasn't Laurie and you thought this trick up to make me suffer? Well—ha ha ha!— you're the one who's been tricked. Ha ha ha! You've been had good and proper.'
纵声大笑，身子跟着乱动，右腿一曲，右手已抓住了匕首柄，极慢极慢的从剑鞘中拔出，不发出丝毫声息，就算有了些微声，也教笑声给遮掩住了。	He kept up the artificial laughter in order to cover up the wriggling of his body. While he was talking and laughing he had managed to draw up his right leg so that he could get his hand on the dagger in his boot and draw it from its sheath. Any slight sound that this operation might have given rise to was masked by his idiotic cachinnation.
海老公道：“我上了你什么大当啦？”	'What do you mean?' said the old eunuch. 'How have I been had?'
韦小宝胡说八道，原是要教他分心，心想索性再胡说八道一番，说道：“汤里有毒药，第一天我就尝了出来。	Trinket had to go on talking in order to keep the old man's attention distracted. Any old nonsense would do. 'I could tell there was something funny about that soup the very first day I tasted it, ' he said.
我跟小玄子商量，他说你在下毒害我……”	'I asked Misty about it and he told me you were trying to poison me . . .'
海老公一惊，道：“皇上早知道了？”	The old eunuch was clearly startled by this. 'The Emperor knew this?'
韦小宝道：“怎么会不知道？ 只不过那时我可还不知他是皇上，小玄子叫我不动声色，留神提防，喝汤之时只喝入口中，随后都吐在碗里，反正你又瞧不见。”	'Of course he did, ' said Trinket, '—though I didn't realize at the time that he was the Emperor. Misty advised me not to let on that I knew. He said pretend to drink the soup but don't swallow it; then afterwards you can spit it back in the bowl. So that's what I did. It wasn't very difficult to fool you because you couldn't see.'
一面说，一面将匕首半寸半寸的提起，剑尖缓缓对准了海老公心口，心想若不是一下子便将他刺死，纵然刺中了，他一掌击下来，自己还是没命。	All the while he was saying this, he was raising the dagger inch by inch and aiming it at the pit of the old man's stomach. He knew that in order to succeed he would have to kill him instantly. Even a correctly aimed blow, if it did not kill him at once, would cost him his own life.
海老公将信将疑，冷笑道：“你如没喝汤，干么一按左边肚子，又会痛得这么厉害？”	The old eunuch wasn't sure whether to believe him or not. 'If you didn't drink the soup, ' he said, 'how is it that it hurt so badly when you pressed your belly?'
韦小宝叹道：“想是我虽将汤吐了出来，差着没漱口，毒药还是吃进了肚里。”	Trinket affected a sigh. 'I suppose it's because I didn't rinse my mouth after spitting it out. Some of the poison must still have got into my stomach.'
说着又将匕首移近数寸。	While he was saying this he managed to move the dagger a few inches nearer.
只听海老公道：“那也很好啊。	'Good!' said the old eunuch.
反正这毒药是解不了的，你中毒浅些，发作得慢些，吃的苦头只有更大。”	The important thing is, there's no cure; so though you've had a lighter dose, all that means is that the poison will act more slowly and you will have that much longer to suffer.'
韦小宝哈哈大笑，长笑声中，全身力道集于右臂，猛力戳出，直指海老公心口，只待一刀刺入，便即滚向床角，从床脚边窜出逃走。	Trinket began laughing loudly again. Under cover of his laughter he made a tremendous stab, concentrating all the strength of his body into his right arm and aiming at a place he had chosen just beneath the old man's ribs. He had worked out in advance that, after driving the dagger home, he would roll towards the corner of the bed, crawl out from under the foot of it, and make for the still open door.
海老公陡觉一阵寒气扑面，微感诧异，只知对方已然动手，更不及多想他是如何出手，左手挥出，便往戳来的兵刃上格去，右掌随出，砰的一声，将韦小宝打得飞身而起，撞破窗格，直摔入窗外的花园，跟着只觉左手剧痛，四根手指已被匕首切断。	But at that very moment the old eunuch sensed a slight coldness of the air caused by the proximity of the metal. Surprised but, because of a lifetime of training, never totally off his guard, he raised his left hand almost automatically to fend off an attack—though of what nature, he had no time to think—while his right hand followed with a blow of such giant force that it knocked Trinket flying through the papered lattice of the bedside window and into the garden outside. Almost at the same time the old eunuch became aware of an agonizing pain in his left hand. The dagger had severed all four of the fingers on it.
若不是韦小宝匕首上寒气太盛，他事先没有警兆，这一下非戳中心口不可。	
但如是寻常刀剑，二人功力相差太远，虽然戳中心口，也不过皮肉之伤，他内劲到处，掌缘如铁，击在刀剑之上，震飞刀剑，也不会伤到自己手掌。	
但这匕首实在太过锋锐，海老公苦练数十年的内劲，竟然不能将之震飞脱手，反而无声息的切断了四根手指。	
可是他右手一掌结结实实的打在韦小宝胸口，这一掌开碑裂石，非同小可，料得定韦小宝早已五脏俱碎，人在飞出窗外之前便已死了。	The old man calculated that the blow must have killed Trinket instantaneously and that he was probably already dead when he crashed through the window.
他冷笑一声，自言自语：“死得这般容易，可便宜了这小鬼。”	'Pity!' he muttered to himself, smiling grimly. The little devil didn't deserve to die so quickly.'
定一定神，到药箱中取出金创药敷上伤口，撕下床单，包扎了左掌，喃喃的道：“这小鬼用的是什么兵刃，怎地如此厉害？”	When he had recovered somewhat from the shock of his own gruesome accident, he went to his medicine chest and got out some wound-powder to put on the bleeding stumps; then he tore a strip off the bed-sheet to bind up his left hand with, continuing to mutter to himself as he did so. 'Where on earth could the little devil have got hold of a blade like that? I've never come across anything so sharp in my life before.'
强忍手上剧痛，跃出窗去，伸手往韦小宝跌落处摸去，要找那柄自己闻所未闻、见所未见的宝刀利刃。 哪知摸索良久，竟什么也没摸到。	Forcing himself to endure the excruciating pain in his hand, he jumped through the broken window into the garden, groped his way to the place where he thought Trinket must have fallen, and began feeling around for this extraordinary weapon; but though he searched for a long time, he could not find it.
他于眼睛未瞎之时，窗外的花园早看得熟了，何处有花，何处有石，无不了然于胸。	Because he had come to know the garden so well while he still had his sight, he retained a clear memory of where each rock and shrub was situated.
明明听得韦小宝是落在一株芍药花旁，这小鬼手中的宝剑或许已震得远远飞出，可是他的尸体怎会突然不见？	According to his calculation, Trinket must have fallen into the bed of peonies. He could understand that the weapon might have flown from his hand and be lying at quite some distance away, but where was the body?
韦小宝中了这掌，当时气为之窒，胸口剧痛，四肢百骸似乎都已寸寸碎裂，一摔下地，险些便即晕去。 他知此刻生死系于一线，既然没能将海老公刺死，老乌龟定会出来追击，当即奋力爬起，只走得两步，脚下一软，又即摔倒，骨碌碌的从一道斜坡上直滚下去。	The blow that Trinket sustained had knocked all the air out of his lungs and caused an agonizing pain in his chest, coupled with the feeling that every bone in his body had been broken. When he hit the ground, he very nearly fainted; but somewhere at the back of his fading consciousness there was an awareness that to lie where he was would mean certain death, for the old eunuch had not been killed and would certainly come after him to finish him off. Making a supreme effort, he struggled to his feet, but after staggering no more than a couple of steps, his legs gave way and he collapsed once more onto the ground. Fortunately the place where he had fallen was the beginning of a fairly steep declivity in an open part of the garden, so instead of lying where he fell, he began rolling downwards.
海老公倘若手指没给割断，韦小宝滚下斜坡之声自然逃不过他耳朵，只是他重伤之余，心烦意乱，加之做梦也想不到这小鬼中了自己这一掌竟会不死，虽然听到声音，却全没想到其中缘由。	If the old eunuch had not been so distracted by pain, he would probably have heard something; though so certain was he that the boy was dead, that even if he had, he would probably have attributed the sound to some other cause.
这条斜坡好长，韦小宝直滚出十余丈，这才停住。	The slope was a long one and Trinket must have rolled a dozen yards or more before his body came to rest.
他挣扎着站起，慢慢走远，周身筋骨痛楚不堪，幸好匕首还是握在手中，暗自庆幸：“刚才老乌龟将我打出窗外，我居然没将匕首插入自己身体，当真运气好极。”	He struggled to his feet and began walking again in the same direction. This time, though his whole body hurt unbearably, he did not fall. Incredibly, he was still holding the dagger tightly in his hand. 'I think I must have a lucky streak,' he said to himself when he became aware of this. 'After being knocked through the window and rolling down the bank and everything, it's a miracle I didn't cut myself.'
将匕首插入靴筒，心想：“西洋镜已经拆穿，老乌龟既知我是冒牌货，宫中是不能再住了。	He stopped for a moment to put the dagger back inside his boot. 'Well, the cat's really out of the bag now, ' he thought. 'If the Old Devil knows I'm not what I'm pretending to be, I can't stay in the Palace a moment longer.
只可惜四十五万两银子变成了一场空欢喜。	Pity about that half a million taels though.
他奶奶的，一个人哪有这样好运气，横财一发便是四十五万两？ 总而言之，老子有过四十五万两银子的身家，只不过老子手段阔绰，一晚之间就花了个精光。	Fancy winning all that money in a single go and then losing the lot in an evening!
你说够厉害了罢？”	That's what I call real style!'
肚里吹牛，不禁得意起来。	A few minutes before this he had been nearly dead, but now, after a little boasting, he was on top of the world.
又想：“那小宫女还巴巴的在等我，反正三更半夜也不能出宫，我这就瞧瞧她去，啊哟……”	'That little maid will be wondering what's become of me,' he thought. 'I can't get out of the Palace anyway in the middle of the night, so I might as well still go and see her. —Aiyo!'
一摸怀中那只纸盒，早已压得一塌胡涂，心道：“我还是拿去给她看看，免她等得心焦。	Fishing it out from inside his gown, he found that the box of honey-cakes had, as he feared, been squashed completely flat. 'Better take this as evidence, in case she's feeling cross because I've kept her waiting so long, ' he thought.
就说我摔了一交，将蜜饯糖果压得稀烂，变成了一堆牛粪，不过这堆牛粪又甜又香，滋味挺美。	'I'll tell her I had a fall. Ha! Some fall! It's turned the cakes into a cow-pat.'
	He sampled a small piece of the sticky mess.
哈哈，辣块妈妈，又甜又香的牛粪你吃过没有？	'Hot-piece tamardy, this is really nice! Have you ever eaten a piece of cow-pat?
老子就吃过。”	Do try some, it's delicious!'
他想想觉得好玩，加快脚步，步向太后所住的慈宁宫，只走快几步，胸口随即剧痛，只得又放慢了步子。	As he started walking again, this time in the direction of the Hall of Maternal Tranquillity, the Empress Dowager's compound, he was feeling so cock-a-hoop that he was stepping out at quite a pace. The result was a most frightful pain in his chest which at once slowed him down to a shuffle.
来到慈宁宫外，见宫门紧闭，心想：“糟糕，可没想到这门会关着，那怎么进去？”	When he reached his goal, however, he found the gate tightly closed. 'Damn!' he thought. 'I didn't think this one would be shut. Now how the devil am I going to get inside?'
正没做理会处，宫门忽然无声无息的推了开来，一个小姑娘的头探出来，月光下看得分明，正是蕊初。	Just as he was wondering what to do next, the gate suddenly opened a bit and a girl's head popped out which he recognized in the moonlight as Blossom's.
只见她微笑着招手，韦小宝大喜，轻轻闪身过门。 蕊初又将门掩上了，在他耳畔低声道：“我怕你进不来，已在这里等了许久。”	She smiled at him and beckoned to him to come in. He complied happily, and when he had slipped inside, she fastened the gate after him. 'I thought I'd better wait here in case you had trouble getting in,' she said softly in his ear. 'I've been waiting ever such a long time.'
韦小宝也低声道：“我来迟啦。 我在路上绊到了一只又臭又硬的老乌龟，摔了一交。”	'I know, I'm late,' Trinket whispered back, 'but I had a fall on the way. I tripped over a horrible old turtle.'
蕊初道：“花园里有大海龟吗？	'I didn't know there were any in the Palace,' said Blossom.
我倒没见过。	'I've never seen one.
你…… 你可摔痛了没有？”	Did you hurt yourself?'
韦小宝一鼓作气的走来，身上的疼痛倒也可以耐得，给蕊初这么一问，只觉得全身筋骨无处不痛，忍不住哼了一声。	The effort of getting to this appointment had absorbed so much of his attention that it had almost taken his mind off the pain; but as soon as she asked the question he became aware that he was hurting dreadfully all over and groaned in spite of himself.
蕊初拉住他手，低声问：“摔痛了哪里？”	Blossom seized his hand in her own. 'Where does it hurt?' she asked in an anxious whisper.
韦小宝正要回答，忽见地下有个黑影掠过，一抬头，但见一只硕大无朋的大鹰从墙头飞了进来，轻轻落地。	As Trinket was on the point of answering her, a shadow appeared on the ground and he looked up to see a dark figure like a great eagle floating down from the top of the garden wall and softly alighting at the foot of it.
他大吃一惊，险些骇呼出声，月光下只见那大鹰人立起来，原来不是大鹰，却是一人。 这人身材瘦削，弯腰曲背，却不是海老公是谁？	He was so startled that he almost called out. While he watched, the monstrous bird-shape transformed itself into a much taller, thinner shape which he could see now, in the light of the moon, was no eagle but a man—a tall, thin man with hunched shoulders and a rounded back: none other, in fact, than Old Hai the eunuch.
蕊初本来面向着他，没见到海老公进来，但见韦小宝转过了头，瞪目而视，脸上满是惊骇之色，也转过身来。	Blossom, who had her face towards Trinket and away from the wall, had not seen this apparition; but when Trinket fell silent and turned to stare at something with a startled look on his face, she turned to look as well.
韦小宝左手一探，已按住了她的嘴唇，出力奇重，竟不让她发出半点声音，跟着右手急摇，示意不可作声。	The next moment Trinket had his hand over her mouth, holding it perhaps rather tighter than was necessary for fear she might cry out. At the same time he signalled to her with his other hand to keep quiet.
蕊初点了点头。 韦小宝这才慢慢放开了左手，目不转睛的瞧着海老公。	When she nodded to show that she understood, he slowly withdrew the hand from her mouth, though all the time keeping his eyes on the old eunuch.
只见海老公僵立当地，似在倾听动静，过了一会，才慢慢向前走去。	Old Hai had now straightened himself up and was standing rather stiffly with his head cocked to one side as if listening for something. After a while he began, very slowly, to move forwards.
韦小宝见他不是向自己走来，暗暗舒了口气，心道：“老乌龟好厉害，眼睛虽然瞎了，居然能追到这里。”	Trinket breathed a silent sigh of relief when he saw that he was not walking in his direction. 'Who'd have thought the Old Turtle would be able to follow me all the way here in spite of being blind?' he thought.
又想：“只要我和这小宫女不发出半点声音，老乌龟就找不到我。”	'Still, provided neither of us makes any noise, he isn't likely to find me.'
海老公向前走了几步，突然跃起，落在韦小宝跟前，左手一探，扠住了蕊初的脖子。	After taking a few steps forwards, the old eunuch made a sudden leap sideways which brought him right in front of Trinket; then, shooting out his right arm, he grasped Blossom round the neck.
蕊初“啊”的一声叫，但咽喉被卡，这一声叫得又低又闷。	She tried to scream, but because of the pressure on her throat, it was only a little smothered sound that came out.
韦小宝心念电转：“老乌龟找的是我，又不是找这小宫女，不会杀死她的。”	'It's me he's after, not this girl,' thought Trinket. 'I don't think he'll kill her.'
此时和海老公相距不过两尺，吓得几乎要撒尿，却一动也不动，知道只要自己动上一根手指，就会给他听了出来。	He was only a couple of feet away from the old man and so scared that he was nearly wetting himself, but he dared not budge an inch, knowing that if he made the slightest movement he would be heard.
海老公低声道：“别作声！	'Don't make any noise,' the old eunuch hissed to Blossom.
不听话就卡死你。	'If you don't do as I tell you, I shall strangle you.
轻轻回答我的话。 你是谁？”	Now tell me, but keep your voice down, who are you?'
蕊初低声道：“我…… 我……”	'I. . . I. . .' Blossom began.
海老公伸出右手，摸了摸她头顶，又摸了摸她脸蛋，道：“你是个小宫女，是不是？”	The old eunuch ran his hand over her head, then over her face. ''You're one of the maids-in-waiting, aren't you?' he said.
蕊初道：“是，是！”	'Yes,' said Blossom in a little voice.
海老公道：“三更半夜的，在这里干什么？”	'So what are you doing out here in the middle of the night?'
蕊初道：“我…… 我在这里玩儿！”	'I'm just. . . just playing,' said Blossom.
海老公脸上露出一丝微笑，在惨淡的月光下看来，反显得更加阴森可怖，问道：“还有谁在这里？”	A faint smile appeared on the face of the old eunuch which the dim moonlight transformed into a ghastly leer. 'Who is here with you?'
侧过了头倾听。	He cocked his head to listen.
适才蕊初不知屏息凝气，惊恐之下呼吸粗重，给海老公听出了她站立之处。	What had enabled him to tell where Blossom was standing was the fact that she did not know how to control her breathing and had been breathing rather heavily because she was frightened.
韦小宝和他相距虽近，呼吸极微，他一时便未察觉。	He hadn't been aware of Trinket's presence because Trinket's breathing was more restrained.
韦小宝想要打手势叫她别说，却又不敢移动手臂。	When Trinket heard the old eunuch's question, he wanted to signal to Blossom not to let on that he was there, but dared not risk even moving his hand.
幸好蕊初乖觉，发觉他双眼已盲，说道：“没…… 没有了。”	Fortunately Blossom's quick wits had already sensed that the old man was blind and she said 'no one' without needing to be told.
海老公道：“皇太后住在哪里？	'Where are the Empress Dowager's rooms?' said the old eunuch.
你带我去见她。”	'Take me to her!'
蕊初惊道：“公公，你…… 你别跟皇太后说，下次…… 下次我再也不敢了。”	'Goong-goong, please, ' said Blossom pleadingly, 'please don't tell her. I... I promise never to do this again.'
她只道这老太监捉住了自己，要去禀报太后。	She assumed that he intended to report her for being caught wandering outside at an unauthorized hour.
海老公道：“你求也没用。	'No use bleating,' said the old eunuch.
不带我去，立刻便扠死你。”	Take me to her, or I'll strangle you this minute.'
手上微一使劲，蕊初气为之窒，一张小脸登时胀得通红。	He increased the pressure on her throat so that she could no longer breathe and her face became swollen and purple.
韦小宝惊惶之下，终于撒出尿来，从裤裆里一滴一滴的往下直流，幸好海老公没留神，就算听到了，也道是蕊初吓得撒尿。	Trinket was so frightened that he lost control of his bladder and piss soaked through his trousers and began falling drip after drip on the ground. Fortunately the faint sound it made was not detected by the old eunuch; or if it was, he must have assumed that it was the little maid of honour who was wetting herself.
海老公慢慢松开左手，低声道：“快带我去。”	He released the pressure on her throat. 'Come on! Take me there!'
蕊初无奈，只得道：“好！” 侧头向韦小宝瞧了一眼，脸上神色示意他快走，自己决不供他出来，低声道：“太后寝宫在那边！”	Blossom had no choice but to obey, but before they went, she shot a look full of tenderness at Trinket which seemed to say, 'Go, quickly! I promise I won't give you away.' 'That's the Empress Dowager's bedroom, over there,' she whispered, temporarily forgetting that the old man couldn't see.
慢慢移动脚步。	She began walking, very slowly, in the direction she had indicated.
海老公的左手仍是抓住她咽喉，和她并肩而行。	The old eunuch walked beside her, his right hand still encircling her throat.
韦小宝寻思：“老乌龟定是去跟皇太后说，我是冒充的小太监，小桂子是给我杀死的，他自己的眼睛是给我弄瞎的，要太后立刻下令捉拿。	'The Old Devil's going to tell the Empress Dowager about me,' thought Trinket. 'He'll tell her everything—how I killed Laurie and dressed up in his clothes, and how I made him blind, and he'll ask her to have me arrested.
他为甚么不去禀报皇上？	But I wonder why he doesn't tell the Emperor?
是了，他知道皇上对我好，告状多半告不进。	I suppose it's because he knows the Emperor likes me and is afraid he might not do anything about it.
那…… 那便如何是好？	Oh help! What am I going to do?
我须得立即逃出宫去。	I have to get out of this Palace as quickly as possible.
啊哟，不好，这时候宫门早闭，又怎逃得出去？	Aiyo, I can't though! The gates will have been shut long ago.
只要过得片刻，太后传下命令，更是插翅难飞了。”	It won't be long now before the Empress Dowager gives orders for my arrest. I shan't get away then, even if I grow wings.'
