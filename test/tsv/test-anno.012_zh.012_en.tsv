话说宝玉养过了三十三天之后，不但身体强壮，亦且连脸上疮痕平复，仍回大观园去。	By the time the thirty-three days' convalescence had ended, not only were Bao-yu's health and strength completely restored, but even the burn-marks on his face had vanished, and he was allowed to move back into the Garden.
这也不在话下。	
且说近日宝玉病的时节，贾芸带着家下小厮坐更看守，昼夜在这里；那小红同众丫鬟也在这里守着宝玉。	It may be recalled that when Bao-yu's sickness was at its height, it had been found necessary to call in Jia Yun with a number of pages under his command to take turns in watching over him. Crimson was there too at that time, having been brought in with the other maids from his apartment.
彼此相见日多，渐渐的混熟了。	During those few days she and Jia Yun therefore had ample opportunity of seeing each other, and a certain familiarity began to grow up between them.
小红见贾芸手里拿着块绢子，倒像是自己从前掉的，待要问他，又不好问。	Crimson noticed that Jia Yun was often to be seen sporting a handkerchief very much like the one she had lost. She nearly asked him about it, but in the end was too shy.
不料那和尚道士来过，用不着一切男人，贾芸仍种树去了。	Then, after the monk's visit, the presence of the menfolk was no longer required and Jia Yun went back to his tree-planting.
这件事待放下又放不下，待要问去又怕人猜疑。	Though Crimson could still not dismiss the matter entirely from her mind, she did not ask anyone about it for fear of arousing their suspicions.
正是犹豫不决、神魂不定之际，忽听窗外问道：“姐姐在屋里没有？”	A day or two after their return to Green Delights, Crimson was sitting in her room, still brooding over this handkerchief business, when a voice outside the window inquired whether she was in.
小红闻听，在窗眼内望外一看，原来是本院的个小丫头佳蕙，因答说：“在家里呢，你进来罢。”	Peeping through an eyelet in the casement she recognized Melilot, a little maid who belonged to the same apartment as herself. 'Yes, I'm in,' she said. 'Come inside!'
佳蕙听了跑进来，就坐在床上，笑道：“我好造化!	Little Melilot came bounding in and sat down on the bed with a giggle. 'I'm in luck!' she said.
才在院子里洗东西，宝玉叫往林姑娘那里送茶叶，花大姐姐交给我送去。	'I was washing some things in the yard when Bao-yu asked for some tea to be taken round to Miss Lin's for him and Miss Aroma gave me the job of taking it.
可巧老太太给林姑娘送钱来，正分给他们的丫头们呢，见我去了，林姑娘就抓了两把给我。	When I got there, Miss Lin had just been given some money by Her Old Ladyship and was sharing it out among her maids, so when she saw me she just said "Here you are!" and gave me two big handfuls of it.
也不知是多少，你替我收着。”	I've no idea how much it is. Will you look after it for me, please?'
便把手绢子打开，把钱倒出来交给小红。	She undid her handkerchief and poured out a shower of coins.
小红就替他一五一十的数了收起。	Crimson carefully counted them for her and put them away in a safe place.
佳蕙道：“你这两日心里到底觉着怎么样?	'What's been the matter with you lately?' said Melilot.
依我说，你竟家去住两日，请一个大夫来瞧瞧，吃两剂药，就好了。”	'If you ask me, I think you ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor. I expect you need some medicine.'
小红道：“那里的话?	'Silly!' said Crimson.
好好儿的，家去做什么？”	'I'm perfectly all right. What should I want to go home for?'
佳蕙道：“我想起来了。	'I know what, then,' said Melilot.
林姑娘生的弱，时常他吃药，你就和他要些来吃，也是一样。”	'Miss Lin's very weakly. She's always taking medicine. Why don't you ask her to give you some of hers? It would probably do just as well.'
小红道：“胡说！	'Oh, nonsense!' said Crimson.
药也是混吃的？”	'You can't take other people's medicines just like that!'
佳蕙道：“你这也不是个长法儿，又懒吃懒喝的，终久怎么样？”	'Well, you can't go on in this way,' said Melilot, 'never eating or drinking properly. What will become of you?
小红道：“怕什么?	'Who cares?' said Crimson.
还不如早些死了倒干净。”	'The sooner I'm dead the better!'
佳蕙道：“好好儿的，怎么说这些话？”	'You shouldn't say such things,' said Melilot, 'It isn't right.'
小红道：“你那里知道我心里的事！”	'Why not?' said Crimson. 'How do you know what is on my mind?'
佳蕙点头，想了一会道：“可也怨不得你。	Melilot shook her head sympathetically. 'I can't say I really blame you,' she said.
这个地方，本也难站。	'Things are very difficult here at times.
就像昨儿老太太因宝玉病了这些日子，说伏侍的人都辛苦了，如今身上好了，各处还香了愿，叫把跟着的人都按着等儿赏他们。	Take yesterday, for example. Her Old Ladyship said that as Bao-yu was better now and there was to be a thanksgiving for his recovery, all those who had the trouble of nursing him during his illness were to be rewarded according to their grades.
我们算年纪小，上不去，我也不抱怨；像你怎么也不算在里头?	Well now, I can understand the very young ones like me not being included, but why should they leave you out?
我心里就不服。	I felt really sorry for you when I heard that they'd left you out.
袭人那怕他得十分儿，也不恼他，原该的。	Aroma, of course, you'd expect to get more than anyone else. I don't blame her at all. In fact, I think it's owing to her.
说句良心话，谁还能比他呢?	Let's be honest: none of us can compare with Aroma.
别说他素日殷勤小心，就是不殷勤小心，也拼不得。	I mean, even if she didn't always take so much trouble over everything, no one would want to quarrel about her having a bigger share.
只可气晴雯绮霞他们这几个都算在上等里去，伏着宝玉疼他们，众人就都捧着他们。	What makes me so angry is that people like Skybright and Mackerel should count as top grade when everyone knows they're only put there to curry favour with Bao-yu.
你说可气不可气？”	Doesn't it make you angry?'
小红道：“也犯不着气他们。	'I don't see much point in getting angry,' said Crimson.
俗语说的：‘千里搭长棚——没有个不散的筵席。’	'You know what they said about the mile-wide marquee: "Even the longest party must have an end"?
谁守一辈子呢?	Well, none of us is here for ever, you know.
不过三年五载，各人干各人的去了，那时谁还管谁呢？”	Another four or five years from now when we've each gone our different ways it won't matter any longer what all the rest of us are doing.'
这两句话不觉感动了佳蕙心肠，由不得眼圈儿红了，又不好意思无端的哭，只得勉强笑道：“你这话说的是。	Little Melilot found this talk of parting and impermanence vaguely affecting and a slight moisture was to be observed about her eyes. She thought shame to cry without good cause, however, and masked her emotion with a smile: 'That's perfectly true.
昨儿宝玉还说：明儿怎么收拾房子，怎么做衣裳。 倒像有几百年熬煎似的。”	Only yesterday Bao-yu was going on about all the things he's going to do to his rooms and the clothes he's going to have made and everything, just as if he had a hundred or two years ahead of him with nothing to do but kill time in.'
小红听了，冷笑两声，方要说话，只见一个未留头的小丫头走进来，手里拿着些花样子并两张纸，说道：“这两个花样子叫你描出来呢。”	Crimson laughed scornfully, though whether at Melilot's simplicity or at Bao-yu's improvidence is unclear, since just as she was about to comment, a little maid came running in, so young that her hair was still done up in two little girl's horns. She was carrying some patterns and sheets of paper. 'You're to copy out these two patterns.'
说着，向小红撂下，回转身就跑了。	She threw them in Crimson's direction and straightway darted out again.
小红向外问道：“到底是谁的?	Crimson shouted after her: 'Who are they for, then?
也等不的说完就跑。	You might at least finish your message before rushing off.
‘谁蒸下馒头等着你——怕冷了不成？’”	What are you in such a tearing hurry about? Is someone steaming wheatcakes for you and you're afraid they'll get cold?'
那小丫头在窗外只说得一声：“是绮大姐姐的。” 抬起脚来，咕咚咕咚又跑了。	'They're for Mackerel.' The little maid paused long enough to bawl an answer through the window, then picking up her heels, went pounding off, plim-plam, plim-plam, plim-plam, as fast as she had come.
小红便赌气把那样子撂在一边，向抽屉内找笔。	Crimson threw the patterns crossly to one side and went to hunt in her drawer for a brush to trace them with.
找了半天，都是秃的，因说道：“前儿一枝新笔放在那里了? 怎么想不起来？”	After rummaging for several minutes she had only succeeded in finding a few worn-out ones, too moulted for use. 'Funny!' she said. 'I could have sworn I put a new one in there the other day ...'
一面说，一面出神，想了一回，方笑道：“是了，前儿晚上莺儿拿了去了。”	She thought a bit, then laughed at herself as she remembered: 'Of course. Oriole took it, the evening before last.'
因向佳蕙道：“你替我取了来。”	She turned to Melilot. 'Would you go and get it for me, then?'
佳蕙道：“花大姐姐还等着我替他拿箱子，你自己取去罢。”	'I'm afraid I can't,' said Melilot. 'Miss Aroma's waiting for me to fetch some boxes for her. You'll have to get it yourself.'
小红道：“他等着你，你还坐着闲磕牙儿?	'If Aroma's waiting for you, why have you been sitting here gossiping all this time?' said Crimson.
我不叫你取去，他也不‘等’你了。	'If I hadn't asked you to go and get it, she wouldn't have been waiting, would she?
坏透了的小蹄子！”	Lazy little beast!'
说着自己便出房来。 出了怡红院，一径往宝钗院内来。	She left the room and walked out of the gate of Green Delights and in the direction of Bao-chai's courtyard.
刚至沁芳亭畔，只见宝玉的奶娘李嬷嬷从那边来。 小红立住，笑问道：“李奶奶，你老人家那里去了?	She was just passing by Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when she caught sight of Bao-yu's old wet-nurse, Nannie Li, coming from the opposite direction and stood respectfully aside to wait for her. 'Where have you been, Mrs Li?' she asked her.
怎么打这里来？”	'I didn't expect to see you here.'
李嬷嬷站住，将手一拍，道：“你说，好好儿的，又看上了那个什么‘云哥儿’‘雨哥儿’的，这会子逼着我叫了他来。	Nannie Li made a flapping gesture with her hand: 'What do you think, my dear: His Nibs has taken a fancy to the young fellow who does the tree-planting — "Yin" or "Yun" or whatever his name is — so Nannie has to go and ask him in.
明儿叫上屋里听见，可又是不好。”	Let's hope Their Ladyships don't find out about it. There'll be trouble if they do.'
小红笑道：“你老人家当真的就信着他去叫么？”	'Are you really going to ask him in?'
李嬷嬷道：“可怎么样呢？”	'Yes. Why?'
小红笑道：“那一个要是知好歹，就不进来才是。”	Crimson laughed: 'If your Mr Yun knows what's good for him, he won't agree to come.'
李嬷嬷道：“他又不傻，为什么不进来？”	'He's no fool,' said Nannie Li. 'Why shouldn't he?'
小红道：“既是进来，你老人家该别和他一块儿来；回来叫他一个人混碰，看他怎么样！”	'Any way, if he does come in,' said Crimson, ignoring her question, 'you can't just bring him in and then leave him, Mrs Li. You'll have to take him back again yourself afterwards. You don't want him wandering off on his own. There's no knowing who he might bump into.'
	(Crimson herself, was the secret hope.)
李嬷嬷道：“我有那样大工夫和他走!	'Gracious me! I haven't got that much spare time,' said Nannie Li.
不过告诉了他，回来打发个小丫头子，或是老婆子，带进他来就完了。”	'All I've done is just to tell him that he's got to come. I'll send someone else to fetch him in when I get back presently - one of the girls, or one of the older women, maybe.'
说着拄着拐一径去了。 小红听说，便站着出神，且不去取笔。	She hobbled off on her stick, leaving Crimson standing there in a muse, her mission to fetch the tracing-brush momentarily forgotten.
不多时，只见一个小丫头跑来，见小红站在那里，便问道：“红姐姐，你在这里作什么呢？”	She was still standing there a minute or two later when a little maid came along, who, seeing that it was Crimson, asked her what she was doing there.
小红抬头见是小丫头子坠儿。	Crimson looked up. It was Trinket, another of the maids from Green Delights.
小红道：“那里去？”	'Where are you going?' Crimson asked her.
坠儿道：“叫我带进芸二爷来。”	'I've been sent to fetch Mr Yun,' said Trinket.
	'I have to bring him inside to meet Master Bao.'
说着，一径跑了。	She ran off on her way.
这里小红刚走至蜂腰桥门前，只见那边坠儿引着贾芸来了。	At the gate to Wasp Waist Bridge Crimson ran into Trinket again, this time with Jia Yun in tow.
那贾芸一面走，一面拿眼把小红一溜；那小红只装着和坠儿说话，也把眼去一溜贾芸：四目恰好相对。 小红不觉把脸一红，一扭身往蘅芜院去了。	His eyes sought Crimson's; and hers, as she made pretence of conversing with Trinket, sought his. Their two pairs of eyes met and briefly skirmished; then Crimson felt herself blushing, and turning away abruptly, she made off for Allspice Court.
不在话下。 这里贾芸随着坠儿逶迤来至怡红院中，坠儿先进去回明了，然后方领贾芸进去。	Our narrative now follows Jia Yun and Trinket along the winding pathway to the House of Green Delights. Soon they were at the courtyard gate and Jia Yun waited outside while she went in to announce his arrival. She returned presently to lead him inside.
贾芸看时，只见院内略略有几点山石，种着芭蕉，那边有两只仙鹤，在松树下剔翎。	There were a few scattered rocks in the courtyard and some clumps of jade-green plantain. Two storks stood in the shadow of a pine-tree, preening themselves with their long bills.
一溜回廊上吊着各色笼子，笼着仙禽异鸟。	The gallery surrounding the courtyard was hung with cages of unusual design in which perched or fluttered a wide variety of birds, some of them gay-plumaged exotic ones.
上面小小五间抱厦，一色雕镂新鲜花样槅扇，上面悬着一个匾，四个大字，题道是：“怡红快绿。”	Above the steps was a little five-frame penthouse building with a glimpse of delicately-carved partitions visible through the open doorway, above which a horizontal board hung, inscribed with the words CRIMSON JOYS AND GREEN DELIGHTS
贾芸想道：“怪道叫‘怡红院’，原来匾上是这四个字。”	'So that's why it's called "The House of Green Delights"' Jia Yun told himself. 'The name is taken from the inscription.'
正想着，只听里面隔着纱窗子笑说道：“快进来罢！	A laughing voice addressed him from behind one of the silk gauze casements: 'Come on in!
我怎么就忘了你两三个月！”	It must be two or three months since I first forgot our appointment!'
贾芸听见是宝玉的声音，连忙进入房内，抬头一看，只见金碧辉煌，文章熌烁，却看不见宝玉在那里。	Jia Yun recognized the voice as Bao-yu's and hurried up the steps inside. He looked about him, dazzled by the brilliance of gold and semi-precious inlay-work and the richness of the ornaments and furnishings, but unable to see Bao-yu in the midst of it all.
一回头，只见左边立着一架大穿衣镜，从镜后转出两个一对儿十五六岁的丫头来，说：“请二爷里头屋里坐。”	To the left of him was a full-length mirror from behind which two girls now emerged, both about fifteen or sixteen years old and of much the same build and height. They addressed him by name and asked him to come inside.
贾芸连正眼也不敢看，连忙答应了。	Slightly overawed, he muttered something in reply and hurried after them, not daring to take more than a furtive glance at them from the corner of his eye.
又进一道碧纱厨，只见小小一张填漆床上，悬着大红销金撒花帐子。	They ushered him into a tent-like summer 'cabinet' of green net, whose principal furniture was a tiny lacquered bed with crimson hangings heavily patterned in gold.
宝玉穿着家常衣服，靸着鞋，倚在床上，拿着本书；看见他进来，将书掷下，早带笑立起身来。	On this Bao-yu, wearing everyday clothes and a pair of bedroom slippers, was reclining, book in hand. He threw the book down as Jia Yun entered and rose to his feet with a welcoming smile.
贾芸忙上前请了安，宝玉让坐，便在下面一张椅子上坐了。	Jia Yun swiftly dropped knee and hand to floor in greeting. Bidden to sit, he modestly placed himself on a bedside chair.
宝玉笑道：“只从那个月见了你，我叫你往书房里来，谁知接接连连许多事情，就把你忘了。”	'After I invited you round to my study that day,' said Bao-yu, 'a whole lot of things seemed to happen one after the other, and I'm afraid I quite forgot about your visit.'
贾芸笑道：“总是我没造化，偏又遇着叔叔欠安。	Jia Yun returned his smile: 'Let's just say that it wasn't my luck to see you then. But you have been ill since then, Uncle Bao.
叔叔如今可大安了？”	Are you quite better now?'
宝玉道：“大好了。	'Quite better, thank you.
我倒听见说你辛苦了好几天。”	I hear you've been very busy these last few days.'
贾芸道：“辛苦也是该当的。	'That's as it should be,' said Jia Yun.
叔叔大安了，也是我们一家子的造化。”	'But I'm glad you are better, Uncle. That's a piece of good fortune for all of us.'
说着，只见有个丫鬟端了茶来与他。	As they chatted, a maid came in with some tea.
那贾芸嘴里和宝玉说话，眼睛却瞅那丫鬟：	Jia Yun was talking to Bao-yu as she approached, but his eyes were on her.
细挑身子，容长脸儿，穿着银红袄儿，青缎子坎肩，白绫细褶儿裙子。	She was tall and rather thin with a long oval face, and she was wearing a rose-pink dress over a closely pleated white satin skirt and a black satin sleeveless jacket over the dress.
那贾芸自从宝玉病了，他在里头混了两天，都把有名人口记了一半；他看见这丫鬟，知道是袭人。	In the course of his brief sojourn among them in the early days of Bao-yu's illness, Jia Yun had got by heart the names of most of the principal females of Bao-yu's establishment. He knew at a glance that the maid now serving him tea was Aroma.
他在宝玉房中比别人不同，如今端了茶来，宝玉又在旁边坐着，便忙站起来，笑道：“姐姐怎么给我倒起茶来?	He was also aware that she was in some way more important than the other maids and that to be waited on by her in the seated presence of her master was an honour. Jumping hastily to his feet he addressed her with a modest smile: 'You shouldn't pour tea for me, Miss!
我来到叔叔这里，又不是客，等我自己倒罢了。”	I'm not like a visitor here. You should let me pour for myself!'
宝玉道：“你只管坐着罢。	'Oh do sit down!' said Bao-yu.
丫头们跟前也是这么着。”	'You don't have to be like that in front of the maids!'
贾芸笑道：“虽那么说，叔叔屋里的姐姐们，我怎么敢放肆呢。”	'I know,' said Jia Yun. 'But a body-servant! I don't like to presume.'
一面说，一面坐下吃茶。 那宝玉便和他说些没要紧的散话：	He sat down, nevertheless, and sipped his tea while Bao-yu made conversation on a number of unimportant topics.
又说道谁家的戏子好，谁家的花园好，又告诉他谁家的丫头标致，谁家的酒席丰盛，又是谁家有奇货，又是谁家有异物。	He told him which household kept the best troupe of players, which had the finest gardens, whose maids were the prettiest, who gave the best parties, and who had the best collection of curiosities or the strangest pets.
那贾芸口里只得顺着他说。	Jia Yun did his best to keep up with him.
说了一回，见宝玉有些懒懒的了，便起身告辞。 宝玉也不甚留，只说：“你明儿闲了只管来。” 仍命小丫头子坠儿送出去了。	After a while Bao-yu showed signs of flagging, and when Jia Yun, observing what appeared to be fatigue, rose to take his leave, he did not very strongly press him to stay. 'You must come again when you can spare the time,' said Bao-yu, and ordered Trinket to see him out of the Garden.
贾芸出了怡红院，见四顾无人，便慢慢的停着些走，口里一长一短和坠儿说话。	Once outside the gateway of Green Delights, Jia Yun looked around him on all sides, and having ascertained that there was no one else about, slowed down to a more dawdling pace so that he could ask Trinket a few questions.
先问他：“几岁了?	Indeed, the little maid was subjected to quite a catechism: How old was she?
名字叫什么?	What was her name?
你父母在那行上?	What did her father and mother do?
在宝叔屋里几年了?	How many years had she been working for his Uncle Bao?
一个月多少钱?	How much pay did she get a month?
共总宝叔屋内有几个女孩子？”	How many girls were there working for him altogether?
那坠儿见问，便一桩桩的都告诉他了。	Trinket seemed to have no objection, however, and answered each question as it came.
贾芸又道：“刚才那个和你说话的，他可是叫小红？”	'That girl you were talking to on the way in,' he said, 'isn't her name "Crimson"?'
坠儿笑道：“他就叫小红。	Trinket laughed: 'Yes.
你问他作什么？”	Why do you ask?'
贾芸道：“方才他问你什么绢子，我倒拣了一块。”	'I heard her asking you about a handkerchief. Only it just so happens that I picked one up.'
坠儿听了笑道：“他问了我好几遍：可有看见他的绢子的。	Trinket showed interest. 'She's asked me about that handkerchief of hers a number of times.
我那里那么大工夫管这些事?	I told her, I've got better things to do with my time than go looking for people's handkerchiefs.
今儿他又问我，他说我替他找着了他还谢我呢。	But when she asked me about it again today, she said that if I could find it for her, she'd give me a reward.
才在蘅芜院门口儿说的，二爷也听见了，不是我撒谎。	Come to think of it, you were there when she said that, weren't you? It was when we were outside the gate of Allspice Court. So you can bear me out.
好二爷，你既拣了，给我罢，我看他拿什么谢我。”	Oh Mr Jia, please let me have it if you've picked it up and I'll be able to see what she will give me for it!'
原来上月贾芸进来种树之时，便拣了一块罗帕，知是这园内的人失落的，但不知是那一个人的，故不敢造次。	Jia Yun had picked up a silk handkerchief a month previously at the time when his tree-planting activities had just started. He knew that it must have been dropped by one or another of the female inmates of the Garden, but not knowing which, had not so far ventured to do anything about his discovery.
今听见小红问坠儿，知是他的，心内不胜喜幸。	When earlier on he had heard Crimson question Trinket about her loss, he had realized, with a thrill of pleasure, that the handkerchief he had picked up must have been hers.
又见坠儿追索，心中早得了主意，便向袖内将自己的一块取出来，向坠儿笑道：“我给是给你，你要得了他的谢礼，可不许瞒着我。”	Trinket's request now gave him just the opening he required. He drew a handkerchief of his own from inside his sleeve and held it up in front of her with a smile: 'I'll give it to you on one condition. If she lets you have this reward you were speaking of; you've got to let me know. No cheating, mind!'
坠儿满口里答应了，接了绢子，送出贾芸，回来找小红，不在话下。	Trinket received the handkerchief with eager assurances that he would be informed of the outcome, and having seen him out of the Garden, went back again to look for Crimson.
如今且说宝玉打发贾芸去后，意思懒懒的，歪在床上，似有朦胧之态。	Our narrative returns now to Bao-yu. After disposing of Jia Yun, Bao-yu continued to feel extremely lethargic and lay back on the bed with every appearance of being about to doze off to sleep.
袭人便走上来，坐在床沿上推他，说道：“怎么又要睡觉?	Aroma hurried over to him and, sitting on the edge of the bed, roused him with a shake: 'Come on! Surely you are not going to sleep again?
你闷的很，出去逛逛不好？”	You need some fresh air. Why don't you go outside and walk around for a bit?'
宝玉见说，携着他的手笑道：“我要去，只是舍不得你。”	Bao-yu took her by the hand and smiled at her. 'I'd like to go,' he said, 'but I don't want to leave you.'
袭人笑道：“你没别的说了！”	'Silly!' said Aroma with a laugh. 'Don't say what you don't mean!'
一面说，一面拉起他来。	She hoicked him to his feet.
宝玉道：“可往那里去呢?	'Well, where am I going to go then?' said Bao-yu.
怪腻腻烦烦的。”	'I just feel so bored.'
袭人道：“你出去了就好了。	'Never mind where, just go out!' said Aroma.
只管这么委琐，越发心里腻烦了。”	'If you stay moping indoors like this, you'll get even more bored.'
宝玉无精打彩，只得依他。 晃出了房门，在回廊上调弄了一回雀儿，出至院外，顺着沁芳溪，看了一回金鱼。	Bao-yu followed her advice, albeit half-heartedly, and went out into the courtyard. After visiting the cages in the gallery and playing for a bit with the birds, he ambled out of the courtyard into the Garden and along the batik of Drenched Blossoms Stream, pausing for a while to look at the goldfish in the water.
只见那边山坡上两只小鹿儿箭也似的跑来。	As he did so, a pair of fawns came running like the wind from the hillside opposite.
宝玉不解何意，正自纳闷，只见贾兰在后面，拿着一张小弓儿赶来。	Bao-yu was puzzled. There seemed to be no reason for their mysterious terror. But just then little Jia Lan came running down the same slope after them, a tiny bow clutched in his hand.
一见宝玉在前，便站住了，笑道：“二叔叔在家里呢，我只当出门去了呢。”	Seeing his uncle ahead of him, he stood politely to attention and greeted him cheerfully: 'Hello, Uncle. I didn't know you were at home. I thought you'd gone out.'
宝玉道：“你又淘气了。	'Mischievous little blighter, aren't you?' said Bao-yu.
好好儿的，射他做什么？”	'What do you want to go shooting them for, poor little things?'
贾兰笑道：“这会子不念书，闲着做什么? 所以演习演习骑射。”	'I've got no reading to do today,' said Jia Lan, 'and I don't like to hang about doing nothing, so I thought I'd practise my archery and equitation.'
宝玉道：“磕了牙，那时候儿才不演呢。”	'Goodness! You'd better not waste time jawing, then,' said Bao-yu, and left the young toxophilite to his pursuits.
说着，便顺脚一径来至一个院门前，看那凤尾森森，龙吟细细：正是潇湘馆。	Moving on, without much thinking where he was going, he came presently to the gate of a courtyard. Denser than feathers on the phoenix' tail The stirred leaves murmured with a pent dragon's moan. The multitudinous bamboos and the board above the gate confirmed that his feet had, without conscious direction, carried him to the Naiad's House.
宝玉信步走入，只见湘帘垂地，悄无人声。 走至窗前，觉得一缕幽香从碧纱窗中暗暗透出。	Of their own accord they now carried him through the gateway and into the courtyard. The House seemed silent and deserted, its bamboo door-blind hanging unrolled to the ground; but as he approached the window, he detected a faint sweetness in the air, traceable to a thin curl of incense smoke which drifted out through the green gauze of the casement.
宝玉便将脸贴在纱窗上看时，耳内忽听得细细的长叹了一声，道：“‘每日家，情思睡昏昏！’”	He pressed his face to the gauze; but before his eyes could distinguish anything, his ear became aware of a long, languorous sigh and the sound of a voice speaking: 'Each day in a drowsy waking dream of love.'
宝玉听了，不觉心内痒将起来。	Bao-yu felt a sudden yearning for the speaker.
再看时，只见黛玉在床上伸懒腰。	He could see her now. It was Dai-yu, of course, lying on her bed, stretching herself and yawning luxuriously.
宝玉在窗外笑道：“为什么‘每日家情思睡昏昏’的？” 一面说，一面掀帘子进来了。	He laughed: 'Why "each day in a drowsy waking dream of love"?' he asked through the window (the words were from his beloved Western Chamber); then going to the doorway he lifted up the door-blind and walked into the room.
黛玉自觉忘情，不觉红了脸，拿袖子遮了脸，翻身向里装睡着了。	Dai-yu realized that she had been caught off her guard. She covered her burning face with her sleeve, and turning over towards the wall, pretended to be asleep.
宝玉才走上来，要扳他的身子，只见黛玉的奶娘并两个婆子却跟进来了，说：“妹妹睡觉呢，等醒来再请罢。”	Bao-yu went over intending to turn her back again, but just at that moment Dai-yu's old wet-nurse came hurrying in with two other old women at her heels: 'Miss Lin's asleep, sir. Would you mind coming back again after she's woken up?'
刚说着，黛玉便翻身坐起来，笑道：“谁睡觉呢？”	Dai-yu at once turned over and sat up with a laugh: 'Who's asleep?'
那两三个婆子见黛玉起来，便笑道：“我们只当姑娘睡着了。”	The three old women laughed apologetically. 'Sorry, miss. We thought you were asleep.
说着，便叫紫鹃说：“姑娘醒了，进来伺候。”	Nightingale! Come inside now! Your mistress is awake.'
一面说，一面都去了。	Having shouted for Nightingale, the three guardians of morality retired.
黛玉坐在床上，一面抬手整理鬓发，一面笑向宝玉道：“人家睡觉，你进来做什么？”	'What do you mean by coming into people's rooms when they're asleep?' said Dai-yu, smiling up at Bao-yu as she sat on the bed's edge patting her hair into shape.
宝玉见他星眼微饧，香腮带赤，不觉神魂早荡，一歪身坐在椅子上，笑道：“你才说什么？”	At the sight of those soft cheeks so adorably flushed and the starry eyes a little misted with sleep a wave of emotion passed over him. He sank into a chair and smiled back at her: 'What was that you were saying just now before I came in?'
黛玉道：“我没说什么。”	'I didn't say anything,' said Dai-yu.
宝玉笑道：“给你个榧子吃呢!	Bao-yu laughed and snapped his fingers at her: 'Put that on your tongue, girl!
我都听见了。”	I heard you say it.'
二人正说话，只见紫鹃进来，宝玉笑道：“紫鹃，把你们的好茶沏碗我喝。”	While they were talking to one another, Nightingale came in. 'Nightingale,' said Bao-yu, 'what about a cup of that excellent tea of yours?'
紫鹃道：“我们那里有好的?	'Excellent tea?' said Nightingale. 'There's nothing very special about the tea we drink here.
要好的只好等袭人来。”	If nothing but the best will do, you'd better wait for Aroma to come.'
黛玉道：“别理他。	'Never mind about him!' said Dai-yu.
你先给我舀水去罢。”	'First go and get me some water!'
紫鹃道：“他是客，自然先沏了茶来再舀水去。”	'He is our guest,' said Nightingale. 'I can't fetch you any water until I've given him his tea.'
说着，倒茶去了。	And she went to pour him a cup.
宝玉笑道：“好丫头!	'Good girl!' said Bao-yu.
‘若共你多情小姐同鸳帐，怎舍得叫你叠被铺床？’”	'If with your amorous mistress I should wed, 'Tis you, sweet maid, must make our bridal bed.'
	The words, like Dai-yu's languorous line, were from Western Chamber, but in somewhat dubious taste.
黛玉登时急了，撂下脸来说道：“你说什么？”	Dai-yu was dreadfully offended by them. In an instant the smile had vanished from her face. 'What was that you said?'
宝玉笑道：“我何尝说什么？”	He laughed: 'I didn't say anything.'
黛玉便哭道：“如今新兴的，外头听了村话来，也说给我听；看了混帐书，也拿我取笑儿。	Dai-yu began to cry. 'This is your latest amusement, I suppose. Every time you hear some coarse expression outside or read some crude, disgusting book, you have to come back here and give me the benefit of it.
我成了替爷们解闷儿的了。”	I am to become a source of entertainment for the menfolk now, it seems.'
一面哭，一面下床来，往外就走。	She rose, weeping, from the bed and went outside.
宝玉心下慌了，忙赶上来说：“好妹妹，我一时该死，你好歹别告诉去!	Bao-yu followed her in alarm. 'Dearest coz, it was very wrong of me to say that, but it just slipped out without thinking. Please don't go and tell!
我再敢说这些话，嘴上就长个疔，烂了舌头。”	I promise never to say anything like that again. May my mouth rot and my tongue decay if I do!'
正说着，只见袭人走来，说道：“快回去穿衣裳去罢，老爷叫你呢。”	Just at that moment Aroma came hurrying up: 'Quick!' she said. 'You must come back and change. The Master wants to see you.'
宝玉听了，不觉打了个焦雷一般，也顾不得别的，疾忙回来穿衣服。 出园来，只见焙茗在二门前等着。	The descent of this thunderbolt drove all else from his mind and he rushed off in a panic. As soon as he had changed, he hurried out of the Garden. Tealeaf was waiting for him outside the inner gate.
宝玉问道：“你可知道老爷叫我是为什么？”	'I suppose you don't know what he wants to see me about?' Bao-yu asked him.
焙茗道：“爷快出来罢，横竖是见去的，到那里就知道了。”	'I should hurry up, if I were you,' said Tealeaf. 'All I know is that he wants to see you. You'll find out why soon enough when you get there.'
一面说，一面催着宝玉。	He hustled him along as he spoke.
转过大厅，宝玉心里还自狐疑，只听墙角边一阵呵呵大笑，回头见薛蟠拍着手跳出来，笑道：“要不说姨夫叫你，你那里肯出来的这么快！”	They had passed round the main hall, Bao-yu still in a state of fluttering apprehensiveness when there was a loud guffaw from a corner of the wall. It was Xue Pan, clapping his hands and stamping his feet in mirth. 'Ho! Ho! Ho! You'd never have come this quickly if you hadn't been told that Uncle wanted you!'
焙茗也笑着跪下了。	Tealeaf, also laughing, fell on his knees.
宝玉怔了半天，方想过来，是薛蟠哄出他来。	Bao-yu stood there looking puzzled. It was some moments before it dawned on him that he had been hoaxed.
薛蟠连忙打恭作揖赔不是，又求：“别难为了小子，都是我央及他去的。”	Xue Pan was by this time being apologetic — bowing repeatedly and pumping his hands to show how sorry he was: 'Don't blame the lad!' he said. 'It wasn't his fault. I talked him into it.'
宝玉也无法了，只好笑问道：“你哄我也罢了，怎么说是老爷呢?	Bao-yu saw that he could do nothing, and might as well accept with a good grace. 'I don't mind being made a fool of,' he said, 'but I think it was going a bit far to bring my father into it.
我告诉姨娘去，评评这个理，可使得么？”	I think perhaps I'd better tell Aunt Xue and see what she thinks about it all.'
薛蟠忙道：“好兄弟，我原为求你快些出来，就忘了忌讳这句话，改日你要哄我，也说我父亲，就完了。”	'Now look here, old chap,' said Xue Pan, getting agitated, 'it was only because I wanted to fetch you out a bit quicker. I admit it was very wrong of me to make free with your Parent, but after all, you've only got to mention my father next time you want to fool me and we'll be quits!'
宝玉道：“嗳哟！	'Aiyo!' said Bao-yu.
越发的该死了。”	'Worse and worse!'
又向焙茗道：“反叛杂种，还跪着做什么？”	He turned to Tealeaf: 'Treacherous little beast! What are you still kneeling for?'
焙茗连忙叩头起来。	Tealeaf kotowed and rose to his feet.
薛蟠道：“要不是，我也不敢惊动：只因下月初三日，是我的生日，谁知老胡和老程他们，不知那里寻了来的：这么粗，这么长，粉脆的鲜藕；这么大的西瓜；这么长，这么大的暹罗国进贡的灵柏香熏的暹罗猪、鱼。	'Look,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise, only it's my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I don't know where they got them from but they've given me: a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as long as that; a huge great melon, look, as big as that; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam.
你说这四样礼物，可难得不难得?	Don't you think it was clever of them to get me those things?
那鱼、猪不过贵而难得，这藕和瓜亏他怎么种出来的!	Maybe not so much the sturgeon and the sucking-pig. They're just expensive. But where would you go to get a piece of lotus root or a melon like that? However did they get them to grow so big?
我先孝敬了母亲，赶着就给你们老太太、姨母送了些去。 如今留了些，我要自己吃恐怕折福，左思右想除我之外惟你还配吃。	I've given some of the stuff to Mother, and while I was about it I sent some round to your grandmother and Auntie Wang, but I've still got a lot left over. I can't eat it all myself: it would be unlucky. But apart from me, the only person I can think of who is worthy to eat a present like this is you.
所以特请你来。	That's why I came over specially to invite you.
可巧唱曲儿的一个小子又来了，我和你乐一天何如？”	And we're lucky, because we've got a little chap who sings coming round as well. So you and I will be able to sit down and make a day of it, eh? Really enjoy ourselves.'
