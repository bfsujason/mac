韦小宝随着关安基、李力世等群豪来到大门外，只见二三百人八字排开，脸上均现兴奋之色。	Trinket accompanied Big Beaver, Brother Li, and the other leaders to the main gate. Outside they found the members of the Lodge already waiting, between two and three hundred of them, spread out in V-shaped formation on either side of the gate, all with eager, expectant looks on their faces.
过了一会，两名大汉抬着担架，抬了茅十八出来。	After a while the same two big fellows came out carrying Whiskers between them in his hammock.
李力世道：“茅兄，你是客人，不用这么客气。”	'Mao, old fellow,' said Brother Li, 'you don't need to wait out here with us. You're our guest.'
茅十八道：“久仰陈总舵主大名，当真如雷贯耳，今日得能拜见，就算…… 就算即刻便死，那…… 那也是不枉了。”	'Just hearing about the Helmsman has always been an inspiration to me,' said Whiskers. 'Now that there's a chance to actually see him, I wouldn't miss it for the world.'
他说话仍是有气没力，但脸泛红光，极是高兴。	Because of his extreme weakness his voice was still faint, but there was a flush of excitement on his pallid cheeks.
耳听得马蹄声渐近，尘头起处，十骑马奔了过来。	Presently the sound of galloping grew nearer and a party of some ten or so horsemen could be seen approaching in a little cloud of dust.
当先三骑马上乘客，没等奔近便翻身下马。	The three foremost of them jumped lightly from their horses while they were still at some distance from the gate.
李力世等迎将上去，与那三人拉手说话，十分亲热。	Brother Li and the other leaders went forward to meet them and there was much exchange of handclasps and friendly greetings.
韦小宝听得其中一人说道：“总舵主在前面相候，请李大哥、关夫子几位过去……”	Trinket overheard one of the horsemen saying that the Helmsman was waiting somewhere 'ahead' and wanted Brother Li, Big Beaver, and one or two other seniors to come and see him.
几个人站着商量了几句，李力世、关安基、祁彪清、玄贞道人等六人便即上马，和来人飞驰而去。	After standing there some minutes in discussion, six leading members of the Lodge—Brother Li, Big Beaver, Tertius, Father Obscurus, and two others whom Trinket didn't know by name—got on to waiting horses and galloped off with the other riders.
茅十八好生失望，问道：“陈总舵主不来了吗？”	'Isn't the Helmsman coming here then?' asked Whiskers, dreadfully disappointed.
对他这句问话，没一人回答得出，各人见不到总舵主，个个垂头丧气。	None of those waiting had the heart to answer him, since they were all feeling equally disappointed.
韦小宝心道：“人家欠了你们一万两银子不还吗？ 还是赌钱输掉了老婆裤子？	'What's the matter with you all?' thought Trinket. 'Anyone would think someone had borrowed ten thousand taels off you and wouldn't pay it back, or you'd lost your wife's trousers gambling or something.
你奶奶的，脸色这等难看！”	What a miserable-looking lot!'
过了良久，有一人骑马驰来传令，点了十三个人的名字，要他们前去会见总舵主。	After a good while longer, another horseman arrived and read out the names of thirteen Lodge-members who were to go for interviews with the Helmsman.
那十三人大喜，飞身上马，向前疾奔。	The thirteen men, with rapturous expressions on their faces, dashed to the ready-waiting horses, jumped into the saddle, and galloped away.
韦小宝问茅十八道：“茅大哥，陈总舵主年纪很老了罢？”	'Whiskers,' Trinket asked his stricken friend, 'is this Helmsman a very old man?'
茅十八道：“我…… 我便是没…… 没见过。	'I... I've never met him,' said Whiskers.
江湖之上，人人都仰慕陈总舵主，但要见上他…… 他老人家一面，可当真艰难得很。”	'On River and Lake there's no one who doesn't look up to him, but I do know that to actually get to meet him is very, very difficult.'
韦小宝嘿了一声，心中却道：“哼，他妈的，好大架子，有什么希罕？	'Tamardy!' thought Trinket. 'What a big-head! Well, you don't impress me, Mr Big Shot Helmsman.
老子才不想见呢。”	It's all the same to me whether I see you or not.'
群豪见这情势，总舵主多半是不会来了，但还是抱着万一希望，站在大门外相候，有的站得久了，便坐了下来。	By this time it was beginning to look as if most members of the Lodge were definitely not going to get a glimpse of their beloved leader; nevertheless they continued to stand there outside the gate, nursing a faint hope that he might after all appear. Some of them, tired of standing, sat on the ground.
有人劝茅十八道：“茅爷，你还是到屋里歇歇。	One of them urged Whiskers to go indoors and rest.
我们总舵主倘若到了，尽快来请茅爷相见。”	'If the Helmsman does come,' he told Whiskers, 'I promise to let you know straight away.'
茅十八摇头道：“不！ 我还是在这里等着。	But Whiskers shook his head. 'No, no, I'd rather wait here.
陈总舵主大驾光临，在下不在门外相候，那…… 那可太也不恭敬了。	If the Helmsman did come and I wasn't waiting here outside, it would be very—well, disrespectful.'
唉，也不知我茅十八这一生一世，有没福份见他老人家一面。”	He sighed wistfully. 'I wonder if it will be my luck to see him before I die.'
韦小宝跟着茅十八从扬州来到北京，一路之上，听他言谈之中，对武林中人物都不大瞧在眼内，但对这个陈总舵主却一直十分敬重，不知不觉的受了感染，心中也不敢再骂人了。	In his conversations with Trinket on the long journey from Yangzhou to Peking there was hardly a well-known practitioner of the Martial Arts whom Whiskers had not at one time or other disparaged. Chen Jinnan, the Helmsman, appeared to be the only expert in these matters for whom he had unqualified respect. Listening to Whiskers now, Trinket could not help absorbing a little of his enthusiasm, to the extent that he now stopped thinking of rude things to say about this paragon who seemed so conscious of his own worth.
忽听得蹄声响动，又有人驰来，坐在地下的会众都跃起身来，大家伸长了脖子张望，均盼总舵主又召人前去相会，这次有自己的份儿。	Suddenly there was a sound of hoofbeats once more and another party of horsemen came riding up. Those Triads who had been sitting on the ground leaped to their feet and everyone craned forward, hoping that this time the summons would be for him.
果然来的又是四名使者，为首一人下马抱拳，说道：“总舵主相请茅十八茅爷、韦小宝韦爷两位，劳驾前去相会。”	There were four messengers this time. Their leader, having dismounted from his horse, clasped his hands together respectfully: 'The Helmsman requests Mr Mao and Mr Wei to favour him with their company.'
茅十八一声欢呼，从担架中跳起身来，但“哎唷”一声，又跌在担架之中，叫道：“快去，快去！”	Whiskers leaped up with a joyful cry, then almost immediately sank back into the hammock with a groan. 'Let's go!' he said to his bearers. 'Hurry!'
韦小宝也是十分高兴，心想：“人家叫我‘公公’的叫得多了，倒没什么人叫我‘韦爷’，哈哈，老子是‘韦小宝韦爷’。”	Trinket, for his part, was extremely tickled to be called 'Mr Wei'. Even his surname—his mother's actually, since his paternity was unknown—was seldom used; but never in his life before had anyone called him 'Mr'. Well!' he thought. 'I've heard plenty of "Goong-goongs" recently; but not "Mr". Ha ha! Now I'm "Mr Trinket Wei".'
两名使者在马上接过担架，双骑相并，缓缓而行。	Two of the mounted men took charge of Whiskers, supporting the ends of the carrying-pole from which his hammock was suspended on their saddle-bows and riding along in parallel very slowly and carefully.
另一名使者将坐骑让给了韦小宝，自己另乘一马，跟随在后。	Another of them gave up his horse to Trinket and found himself another horse on which he rode along behind.
六个人沿着大路行不到三里，便转入右边的一条小路。	The little party of six walked their horses along the road for about a mile before taking a right-hand turn into a little side-road.
一路之上都有三三两两的汉子，或坐或行，巡视把守。 为首的使者伸出中指、无名指、小指三根手指往地下一指，把守二人点点头，也伸手做个暗号。	Along this, every few hundred yards, were little knots of two or three men, some sitting, some walking to and fro, all evidently lookouts, since the leading horseman, on seeing them, would make a sign, stretching out the last three fingers of his right hand and pointing with them downwards, whereupon the men would nod and silently answer him with some mysterious signal of their own.
韦小宝见这些人所发暗号各各不同，也不知是何用意。	Trinket observed that the signals they made were all different, but was unable to guess their significance.
又行了十二三里，来到一座庄院之前。	After they had been riding along this side-road for about four miles, they came to a large farmhouse or grange.
守在门口的一名汉子大声叫道：“客人到！” 跟着大门打开，李力世、关安基，还有两名没见过面的汉子出来，抱拳说道：“茅爷、韦爷，大驾光临，敝会总舵主有请。”	As they arrived at the entrance, a guard on the door shouted to the people inside, 'The guests have arrived,' whereupon the door opened and out came Brother Li, Big Beaver, and two other men whom Trinket hadn't seen before. One of these last clasped his hands politely and welcomed them in: 'Mr Mao, Mr Wei, welcome! Our Society's Helmsman looks forward to meeting you.'
韦小宝大乐，心想：“我这个‘韦爷’毕竟走不了啦！”	Trinket was thrilled. The 'Mr' seemed to be sticking.
茅十八挣扎着想起来，说道：“我这么去见陈总舵主，实在，实在…… 哎唷……” 终于支撑不住，又躺倒在担架上。	Whiskers struggled to get up. 'I can't see the Helmsman like this. It's too . . . it's too . . .' but the effort to raise himself once more ended in a groan.
李力世道：“茅爷身上有伤，不必多礼。”	'You're a wounded man,' said Brother Li. 'You don't need to stand on ceremony.'
让着二人进了大厅。	He ushered Trinket and Whiskers' bearers into the main reception room.
一名汉子向韦小宝道：“韦爷请到这里喝杯茶，总舵主想先和茅爷谈谈。”	A man offered Trinket some tea and asked him to wait there a while as the Helmsman wanted to speak to Mr Mao first.
当下将茅十八抬了进去。	Whiskers was carried through an inner door for his interview.
韦小宝喝得一碗茶，仆役拿上四碟点心，韦小宝吃了一块，心想：“这点心比之皇宫里的，可差得太远了，还及不上丽春院的。”	While Trinket was drinking his cup of tea, a servant came in with four plates on which were various cakes and dimsum. His reaction on sampling these was unfavourable. 'These aren't a patch on the ones they do in the Palace,' he thought. They're not even as good as the ones they used to serve in the brothel.'
对这个总舵主的身份，不免有了一点瞧不起。	His estimation of the Helmsman at once went down a couple of notches.
但肚中正饿，还是将这些瞧不在眼里的点心吃了不少。	However, he was feeling empty, and in quite a short time had made considerable inroads into the eatables on all four of the plates.
过了一顿饭时分，李力世等四人又一起出来，其中一个花白胡子老者道：“总舵主有请韦爷。”	After about the time it would take to consume an average meal, Brother Li and the other three came in again, and one of the two Trinket didn't know by name, an old man with a grizzled beard, told him that the Helmsman was now ready to see him.
韦小宝忙将口中正在咀嚼的点心用力吞落了肚，双手在衣襟上擦了擦，跟着四人入内，来到一间厢房之外。	At some risk of choking, he swallowed the large mouthful he had been chewing, brushed off the crumbs with his hands, and followed the four men into one of the wings of the building which, together with the main reception room, enclosed a large courtyard on three sides.
那老者掀起门帷，说道：“‘小白龙’韦小宝韦爷到！”	There, stopping outside a doorway, the old man with the grizzled beard lifted up the door-curtain and announced them. 'Mr Trinket Wei, the Little White Dragon to see you.'
韦小宝又惊又喜，心想：“他居然知道我这个杜撰的外号，定然是茅大哥说的了。”	Trinket was surprised and a little flattered that they should somehow have got hold of his made-up nom de guerre. This must be Whiskers' doing, he concluded.
房中一个文士打扮的中年书生站起身来，笑容满脸，说道：“请进来！”	A man in his thirties dressed in the costume of a scholar rose to his feet as they entered, smiling a welcome.
韦小宝走进房去，两只眼睛骨碌碌的乱转。	Trinket walked in and stood for a moment darting questioning glances around him.
关安基道：“这位是敝会陈总舵主。”	'This is the Helmsman,' said Big Beaver.
韦小宝微微仰头向他瞧去，见这人神色和蔼，但目光如电，直射过来，不由得吃了一惊，双膝一曲，便即拜倒。 那书生俯身扶起，笑道：“不用多礼。”	Trinket stole a glance at the scholar. He had a mild and gentle face, but there was a force in his flashing eyes which seemed to bore right through him and made him gasp. Almost unconsciously he sank to his knees and began to kowtow; but the scholar bent down to stop him. 'No, no, that's not necessary,' he said with a laugh.
韦小宝双臂被他一托，突然间全身一热，打了个颤，便拜不下去。	Trinket could feel the scholar's strong hands on his arms. A warm sensation passed through his body, followed by a little tremor of excitement. He abandoned his kowtow and got up.
那书生笑道：“这位小兄弟擒杀满洲第一勇士鳌拜，为我无数死在鳌拜手里的汉人同胞报仇雪恨，数日之间，名震天下。	'By arresting and killing Oboi, the Manchu Champion,' said the scholar, speaking to the four older men but keeping his eyes on Trinket, 'our young hero here has avenged the deaths of countless numbers of our fellow-countrymen. In the course of a few days his name has become a household word.
成名如此之早，当真古今罕有。”	To have won such fame, and so early in life too, is an almost unparalleled achievement.'
韦小宝本来脸皮甚厚，倘若旁人如此称赞，便即跟着自吹自擂一番，但在这位不怒自威的总舵主面前，竟然讷讷的不能出口。	Although Trinket had enough cheek to shame the devil and would normally, if anyone else had praised him like this, have treated it as an excuse to show off, he found himself, in the presence of this Helmsman with his gentleness and his air of quiet authority, completely tongue-tied.
总舵主指着一张椅子，微笑道：“请坐！” 自己先坐了，韦小宝便也坐下。 李力世等四人却垂手站立。	'Sit down!' The Helmsman pointed to a chair and sat down himself. Trinket followed his example but noticed that the four older men remained standing, their arms held respectfully at their sides.
总舵主微笑道：“听茅十八茅爷说道，小兄弟在扬州得胜山下，曾用计杀了一名清军军官黑龙鞭史松，初出茅庐第一功，便已不凡。	'I gather that your career as a strategist began very early,' said the Helmsman, smiling. 'Mr Mao tells me that already, near Victory Hill, when you were still not far from Yangzhou, you killed a Manchu officer by means of a ruse.
但不知小兄弟如何擒拿鳌拜。”	I still haven't heard how you managed to arrest Oboi though.'
韦小宝抬起头来，和他目光一触，一颗心不由得突突乱跳，满腹大吹法螺的胡说八道霎时间忘得干干净净，一开口便是真话，将如何得到康熙宠幸、鳌拜如何无礼、自己如何和小皇帝合力擒他之事说了。	Lifting his head slightly, Trinket caught a glimpse of those dazzling eyes and felt his heart beating faster. All desire to indulge in his customary trumpet-blowing drained from him on the instant and he found himself for once giving a completely honest account of what he had done. He told the Helmsman how he had become Kang Xi's favourite; how Oboi had threatened and insulted the young Emperor; and how he and the Emperor had joined forces to take Oboi prisoner.
只是顾全对康熙的义气，不提小皇帝在鳌拜背后出刀子之事。 但这样一来，自己撒香炉灰迷眼、举铜香炉砸头，明知不是下三滥、便是下二滥的手段，却也无法再行隐瞒了。	Out of a sense of loyalty to Kang Xi, he said nothing about Kang Xi stabbing Oboi in the back; but he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he had blinded Oboi with incense-ash and then hit him on the head with a bronze brazier, although he was fully aware that to a man of honour like the Helmsman this would seem, if not a third-rate, certainly a pretty second-rate way of overcoming an enemy.
总舵主一言不发的听完，点头道：“原来如此。	The Helmsman listened to all that Trinket had to say without making a single interruption. When at last Trinket had finished, he nodded. 'I see.
小兄弟的武功和茅爷不是一路，不知尊师是哪一位？”	Well, clearly you didn't learn your technique from Mr Mao. Who was your teacher?'
韦小宝道：“我学过一些功夫，可算不得有什么尊师。	'I've had a little training,' said Trinket, 'but I didn't have a proper teacher.
老乌龟不是真的教我武功，他教我的都是假功夫。”	What the Old Devil taught me wasn't real Martial Arts, it was just rubbish.'
总舵主纵然博知广闻，“老乌龟”是谁，却也不知，问道：“老乌龟？”	'The Old Devil?' The Helmsman's vast knowledge did not encompass any practitioner with that nom de guerre.
韦小宝哈哈大笑，道：“老乌龟便是海老公，他名字叫作海大富。	Trinket burst out laughing. 'Old Devil is what I used to call the old eunuch Hai-goong—among other things. His real name was Hai Dafu.
茅十八大哥和我，就是给他擒进宫里去的……”	He's the one who captured me and Mao Eighteen and brought us into the Palace . . .'
说到这里，突然惊觉不对，自己曾对天地会的人说，茅十八和自己是给鳌拜擒去的，这会儿却说给海老公擒进宫去，岂不是前言不对后语？	He suddenly realized that this flatly contradicted what he had said previously. He had told the Triad members that he and Mao Eighteen had been captured and taken into the Palace by Oboi.
好在他撒谎圆谎的本领着实不小，跟着道：“这老儿奉了鳌拜之命，将我二人擒去，想那鳌拜是个极大的大官，自然不能轻易出手。”	To a practised liar like Trinket, however, this presented little difficulty. The old eunuch was acting on Oboi's orders. I suppose Oboi, being so important, was too grand to do the dirty work himself.'
总舵主沉吟道：“海大富？	But the Helmsman appeared to be deep in thought. 'Hai Dafu?
海大富？	Hai Dafu?
鞑子宫内的太监之中，有这样一号人物？	Is there a eunuch with that name in the Tartar Palace?'
小兄弟，他教你的武功，你演给我瞧瞧。”	He turned to Trinket. 'Show me a few of the things he taught you, little brother,' he said.
韦小宝脸皮再厚，也知自己的武功实在太不高明，说道：“老乌龟教我的都是假功夫。	However immune to self-criticism Trinket might be, he knew that what he liked to call his Martial Arts training was really a joke. 'The Old Devil only pretended to teach me,' he said.
他恨我毒瞎了他眼睛，因此想尽办法来害我。	'He hated me because I made him blind, so he did everything in his power to harm me.
这些功夫是见不得人的。”	The sort of things he taught me were not the sort of things you'd want anyone else to see.'
总舵主点了点头，左手一挥，关安基等四人都退出房去，反手带上了门。	The Helmsman nodded and made a little gesture with his left hand. At once Big Beaver and the other three older men left the room, closing the door after them as they went.
总舵主问道：“你怎样毒瞎了他眼睛？”	'Now,' said the Helmsman, 'what did you mean when you said you made the old eunuch go blind?'
在这位英气逼人的总舵主面前，韦小宝只觉说谎十分辛苦，还是说真话舒服得多，这种情形那可是从所未有，当下便将如何毒瞎海老公、如何杀死小桂子、如何冒充他做小太监等情形说了。	In the presence of this heroic individual Trinket found it harder to tell his habitual lies than to tell the truth—a sensation he had never experienced before. He now found himself telling the Helmsman how the massive dose of medicine he had put in the old eunuch's cup had caused him to go blind and how he had killed the little eunuch Laurie and taken his place.
总舵主又是吃惊，又是好笑，左手在他胯下一拂，发觉他阳具和睾丸都在，并未净身，的的确确不是太监，不由得吁了口长气，微笑道：“好极，好极！	The Helmsman, having heard this last piece of information with amusement and some surprise, felt with his left hand between Trinket's legs and satisfied himself that he was indeed equipped with those parts which eunuchs lack but ordinary little boys possess. Then he gave what to Trinket sounded very much like a sigh of relief. 'Good,' he said with a little smile.
我心中正有个难题，好久拿不定主意，原来小兄弟果然不是给净了身，做了太监！”	'If you haven't been mutilated and you aren't a eunuch, this suggests a way out of a difficulty that has been bothering me for some time.'
左手在桌上轻轻一拍，道：“定当如此！	He tapped the table lightly with his left hand and continued speaking, apparently to himself. 'Yes, of course. This is obviously the solution.
尹兄弟后继有人，青木堂有主儿了。”	It gives Brother Yin a successor and the Green Wood Lodge a Master.'
韦小宝不明白他说些什么，只是见他神色欢愉，确是解开了心中一件极为难之事，也不禁代他高兴。	Trinket didn't understand what he was talking about, but he could tell from his pleased expression that some great weight had been lifted from his mind and couldn't help feeling pleased on his behalf.
总舵主负着双手，在室内走来走去，自言自语：“我天地会所作所为，无一不是前人从所未行之事。	The Helmsman walked to and fro in the room, his hands clasped behind him, muttering to himself. 'Everything this Society has ever done has been unprecedented.
万事开创在我，骇人听闻，物议沸然，又何足论？”	All innovation lies ultimately in the hands of the individual. We must be bold enough to ignore the censures of the vulgar and the loud outcries of those to whom every novelty is shocking.'
他文绉绉的说话，韦小宝更加不懂了。	To Trinket this book-language of the Helmsman's was even more incomprehensible than what he had said before.
总舵主道：“这里只有你我二人，不用怕难为情。	'Look,' said the Helmsman to Trinket, 'there are only two of us here now, so you've no need to feel embarrassed.
那海大富教你的武功，不论真也好，假也好，你试演给我瞧瞧。”	Never mind whether what Hai Dafu taught you was the real thing or not; just give me a demonstration of what it was.'
韦小宝这才明白，他命关安基等四人出去，是为了免得自己怕丑，眼见无可推托，说道：“是老乌龟教的，可不关我事，如果太也可笑，你骂他好了。”	Trinket now realized that it was to spare him the embarrassment of making a fool of himself in front of the others that he had sent them out of the room. There seemed to be nothing for it but to comply. 'Well, it's what the Old Devil taught me,' he said, 'so it's not my fault how bad it is. If it looks really ridiculous, you must put the blame on him.'
总舵主微笑道：“放手练好了，不用担心！”	The Helmsman gave his little smile. 'Don't worry about that; just get on with it.'
韦小宝于是拉开架式，将海老公所教的小半套“大慈大悲千叶手”使了一遍，其中有些忘了，有些也还记得。	So Trinket struck up an attitude and began to go through the motions of the Merciful Guanyin repertoire—the rather limited parts of it, that is, that the old eunuch had taught him. He had already forgotten some bits of it, but could remember enough to put on some sort of performance.
总舵主凝神观看，待韦小宝使完后，点了点头，道：“从你出手中看来，似乎你还学过少林寺的一些擒拿手，是不是？”	The Helmsman watched him with fixed attention and nodded when he had finished. 'From what you've just been doing,' he said, 'it looks as though you may have been taught a little bit of the Shaolin School of Catch-Can. Am I right?'
韦小宝学“大擒拿手”在先，自然知道这门功夫更加不行，原想藏拙，但总舵主似乎什么都知道，只得道：“老乌龟还教过我一些擒拿法，是用来和小皇帝打架的。”	The Greater Catch-Can is what Trinket had learned first, before he even started on the Merciful Guanyin method of self-defence. He knew he must be even worse at Catch-Can than at the Merciful Guanyin stuff and had been hoping to conceal his inadequacy by keeping quiet about it; but there was no concealing anything from the Helmsman, who appeared to know everything: there was nothing for it but to go on making a fool of himself. 'Yes, ' he said. 'The Old Devil taught me a bit of Catch-Can to use in my wrestling-bouts with the Emperor.'
于是将“大擒拿手”中的一些招式也演了一遍。	And he proceeded to demonstrate as much as he could remember of the Greater Catch-Can.
总舵主微微而笑，说道：“不错！”	Once again the Helmsman gave his little smile. 'Not bad!'
韦小宝道：“我早知你见了要笑。”	'I knew all along it would only make you laugh,' said Trinket.
总舵主微笑道：“不是笑你！	'I wasn't laughing at you,' said the Helmsman.
我见了心中喜欢，觉得你记性、悟性都不错，是个可造之材。	'I was smiling because I was pleased to see that your memory and comprehension are so good.
那一招‘白马翻蹄’，海大富故意教错了，但你转到‘鲤鱼托鳃’之时，能自行略加变化，并不拘泥于死招。	That White Pony Kick you couldn't quite bring off I think Hai Dafu must have deliberately taught you incorrectly; but instead of letting it fluster you, you used your own imagination and initiative to develop it into a Carp-Fin Flick.
那好得很！”	I thought that was very good.'
韦小宝灵机一动，寻思：“总舵主的武功似乎比老乌龟又高得多，如果他肯教我武功，我韦小宝定能成为一个真英雄，不再是冒牌货的假英雄。”	Trinket guessed that the Helmsman was a far greater Master of the Martial Arts than the Old Devil had been and the thought suddenly struck him how wonderful it would be if the Helmsman were willing to take him on as a disciple, to be his teacher, his Shifu. Then, surely, he could become a real hero, not the fake one he was at present.
斜头向他瞧去，便在这时，总舵主一双冷电似的目光也正射了过来。	He glanced shyly in the Helmsman's direction and found that cold, electric gaze directed at him.
韦小宝向来惫懒，纵然皇太后如此威严，他也敢对之正视，但在这位总舵主跟前，却半点不敢放肆，目光和他一触，立即收了回来。	Trinket was a shameless young blackguard and could look even the formidable Empress Dowager in the eye without blenching; but the Helmsman was somehow different. In the Helmsman's presence he had become suddenly terrified of misbehaving and as soon as their eyes met had quickly to avert his own.
总舵主缓缓的道：“你可知我们天地会是干什么的？”	'Do you know what the Triad Society is for?' the Helmsman asked him, speaking very slowly and deliberately.
韦小宝道：“天地会反清复明，帮汉人，杀鞑子。”	'The Triad Society wants to drive out the Qing and restore the Ming,' said Trinket. 'It's for helping the Chinese and killing Tartars.'
总舵主点头道：“正是！	The Helmsman nodded. 'Exactly.
你愿不愿意入我天地会做兄弟？”	Would you like to join the Triad Society and become a Brother?'
韦小宝喜道：“那可好极了。”	That would be terrific,' said Trinket delightedly.
在他心目中，天地会会众个个是真正英雄好汉，想不到自己也能为会中兄弟，又想：“连茅大哥也不是天地会的兄弟，我难道比他还行？” 说道：“就怕…… 就怕我够不上格。”	In his mind every member of the Triad Society was a hero. It had not occurred to him that he might ever become one himself. But then he reflected that Whiskers wasn't a member, and it was absurd to imagine that he could be better-qualified than Whiskers; so he said, 'I'm afraid . . . I'm afraid I'm not good enough.'
霎时间眼中放光，满心尽是患得患失之情，只觉这笔天外飞来的横财，多半不是真的，不过总舵主跟自己开开玩笑而已。	His eyes, which for a moment had been shining, were now full of disappointment. It was too much to hope that the Helmsman's offer had been serious. He must have been joking.
总舵主道：“你要入会，倒也可以。 只是我们干的是反清复明的大事，以汉人的江山为重，自己的身家性命为轻。	'If you want to be a member you can,' said the Helmsman, 'only you must remember that this is a very important business we are engaged in. We have to put our country first, even before our lives.
再者，会里规矩严得很，如果犯了，处罚很重，你须得好好想一想。”	Then again, the rules are very strict and the penalties for breaking them very heavy. You need to think carefully before you decide.'
韦小宝道：“不用想，你有什么规矩，我守着便是。	'I don't need to think,' said Trinket. 'Whatever your rules are, I'll keep them.
总舵主，你如许我入会，我可快活死啦。”	If you'll let me join, Helmsman, I'll be the happiest boy in the world.'
总舵主收起了笑容，正色道：“这是极要紧的大事，生死攸关，可不是小孩子们的玩意。”	The Helmsman's smile gave way to a more grave expression. 'This is an extremely serious business, involving matters of life and death. We're not talking about children's games.'
韦小宝道：“我当然知道。	'I know that,' said Trinket.
我听人说，天地会行侠仗义，做得都是惊天动地的大事，怎么会是小孩子的玩意？”	'I've heard lots about the Triad Society. It fights for Honour and Justice. It does all sorts of amazing things. Of course it isn't a children's game.'
总舵主微笑道：“知道了就好，本会入会时有誓词三十六条，又有十禁十刑的严规。”	The Helmsman smiled. 'Well, as long as you know. There are thirty-six rules that everyone joining the Society must swear to follow. The rules include ten absolute prohibitions, each with a very severe punishment laid down for anyone who breaks it.'
说到这里，脸色沉了下来，道：“有些规矩，你眼前年纪还小，还用不上，不过其中有一条：‘ 凡我兄弟，须当信实为本，不得谎言诈骗。’	His face became grave again. 'Some of the rules don't apply in your case yet, because you're too young; but there's one of them against dishonesty. It says, "Every Brother must be honest in all his dealings. He must not lie or cheat."
这一条，你能办到么？”	Do you think you are capable of keeping that rule?'
韦小宝微微一怔，道：“对你总舵主，我自然不敢说谎。 可是对其余兄弟，难道什么事也都要说真话？”	Trinket was slightly taken aback. 'I'd never tell you a lie, Helmsman,' he said, 'but with the other Brothers, would I have to tell them the truth—all the time?'
总舵主道：“小事不论，只论大事。”	'Perhaps not in minor matters,' said the Helmsman, 'but in important ones, yes.'
韦小宝道：“是了。	'Well that's all right,' said Trinket.
好比和会中兄弟们赌钱，出手段骗人可不可以？”	'What about gambling? If I'm gambling with other members of the Society, am I allowed to cheat a bit?'
总舵主没想到他会问及此事，微微一笑，道：“赌钱虽不是好事，会规倒也不禁。	The Helmsman was unprepared for a question of this nature. 'Gambling is not a good thing,' he said with the faintest of smiles, 'but there is nothing in the rules which forbids it.
可是你骗了他们。 他们知道了要打你，会规也不禁止，你岂不挨打吃亏？”	Of course, if you cheated them and they found out, they would probably beat you up, and there's no rule against that either: so you'd probably be well advised not to try.'
韦小宝笑道：“他们不会知道的，其实我不用欺骗，赢钱也是十拿九稳。”	They wouldn't find out,' said Trinket, grinning. 'Actually, though, I don't need to cheat. When I gamble, nine times out of ten I win anyway.'
天地会的会众多是江湖豪杰，赌钱酗酒，乃是天性，向来不以为非，总舵主也就不再理会，向他凝视片刻，道：“你愿不愿拜我为师？”	Since most members of the Society came from a travelling background in which gambling and drunken brawling were accepted as normal behaviour, the Helmsman was inclined to turn a blind eye on these matters. He looked at Trinket intently for some moments as if trying to make his mind up about something. 'Would you like to be my apprentice?'
韦小宝大喜，立即扑翻在地，连连磕头，口称：“师父！”	What happiness! Trinket fell at once to his knees and began kowtowing. 'Shifu!'
总舵主这次不再相扶，由他磕了十几个头，道：“够了！”	This time the Helmsman made no effort to raise him up, but let him knock his head a dozen or more times on the floor before he stopped him. 'All right, that's enough.'
韦小宝喜孜孜的站起身来。	Trinket got up again, smiling delightedly.
总舵主道：“我姓陈，名叫陈近南。 这‘陈近南’三字，是江湖上所用。 你今日既拜我为师，须得知道为师的真名。	'Now that I have become your Shifu, you had better know my real name,' said the Helmsman, 'but you are not to tell anyone. My surname is Chen. I expect you know that already. But Chen Jinnan is only the name I am known by on River and Lake.
我真名叫作陈永华，永远的永，中华之华。”	It is not my real name. My real name is Chen Yonghua.'
说到自己真名时压低了声音。	
韦小宝道：“是，徒弟牢牢记在心中，不敢泄漏。”	'I'll remember that,' said Trinket. 'And I promise not to tell anyone.'
陈近南又向他端相半晌，缓缓说道：“你我既成师徒，相互间什么都不隐瞒。	The Helmsman contemplated his new disciple for some moments in silence. 'Now that we are Shifu and apprentice, ' he said gravely 'we have to be completely open with each other.
我老实跟你说，你油腔滑调，狡猾多诈，跟为师的性格十分不合，我实在并不喜欢，所以收你为徒，其实是为了本会的大事着想。	I don't mind telling you that I find you both glib-tongued and sly. Your nature is a very different one from my own, and I must admit that I am not at all happy about this. In taking you on as my apprentice, it's more the interests of the Society than anything else that I have in mind.'
“韦小宝道：“徒儿以后好好的改。”	'From now on I'll do my best to change,' said Trinket.
陈近南道：“江山易改，本性难移，改是改不了多少的。	'It's easier for the earth to leave its moorings than for a man to change his nature,' said the Helmsman. 'You won't be able to change very much.
你年纪还小，性子浮动些，也没做了什么坏事。	On the other hand you're still young and comparatively unformed; and so far you don't seem to have done anything particularly bad.
以后须当时时记住我的话。	In future you'll just have to keep reminding yourself all the time to do as I tell you.
我对徒儿管教极严，你如犯了本会的规矩，心术不正，为非作歹，为师的要取你性命，易如反掌，也决不怜惜。”	I believe in being very strict with my apprentices, so if I find that you have been breaking the Society's rules or plotting mischief or doing anything really bad, I shall kill you without mercy. And remember: I can kill you any time, as easily as breaking an egg.'
说着左手一探，擦的一声响，将桌子角儿抓了一块下来，双手搓了几搓，木屑纷纷而下。	As if to demonstrate, he tapped the table with his left hand and then seized the corner of it in his grasp. There was a crunching sound as it broke off. Then he took the broken-off piece between his palms and rubbed it until it fell in a shower of tiny slivers on the floor.
韦小宝伸出了舌头，半天缩不进去，随即喜欢得心痒难搔，笑道：“我一定不做坏事。	Trinket stuck his tongue out in amazement and it was some time before he could put it back in again. Yet his overriding feeling was not of amazement but of happiness that he had got this heroic strong man for his teacher. 'I promise you I won't ever do anything bad,' he said.
一做坏事，师父你就在我头上这么一抓，这么一搓。	'I wouldn't want my Shifu to crunch my head up!
再说，只消做得几件坏事，师父你这手功夫便不能传授徒儿了。”	And besides, if I did do a few bad things, and you did crunch me up, with me gone, who'd there be to pass on your secrets!'
陈近南道：“不用几件，只是一件坏事，你我便无师徒之份。”	'Not "a few bad things"!' said the Helmsman. 'One! Just one bad thing, and I shall no longer consider you my apprentice.'
韦小宝道：“两件成不成？”	'What about two bad things?' said Trinket.
陈近南脸一板，道：“你给我正正经经的，少油嘴滑舌。	The Helmsman's face looked stern. 'You're being flippant.
一件便是一件，这种事也有讨价还价的？”	When I say one bad thing I mean one. Do you think this is something you can haggle about?'
韦小宝应道：“是！” 心中却说：“我做半件坏事，却又如何？”	'No, sir,' said Trinket; but a rebellious little voice inside him was saying, 'What about half a bad thing?'
陈近南道：“你是我的第四个徒儿，说不定便是我的关门弟子。	'You are my fourth apprentice,' said the Helmsman, 'and probably you will be my last.
天地会事务繁重，我没功夫再收弟子。	The Triad Society keeps me so busy that I don't have much time for apprentices.
你的三个师兄，两个在与鞑子交战时阵亡，一个死于国姓爷光复台湾之役，都是为国捐躯的大好男儿。	Of your three Brother-apprentices, two died fighting against the Tartars and the third was killed in Marshal Zheng's campaign to retake Taiwan. All three were brave young men who gave their lives for their country.
为师的在武林中位份不低，名声不恶，你可别替我丢脸。”	Apart from that I have my own reputation to keep up and I don't want you disgracing me.'
韦小宝道：“是！	'No, sir,' said Trinket.
不过…… 不过……”	'But. . . but—'
陈近南道：“不过什么？”	'But what?' said the Helmsman.
韦小宝道：“有时我并不想丢脸，不过真要丢脸，也没有法子。	'Sometimes things that might disgrace you seem to happen to me when I can't help it,' said Trinket.
好比打不过人家，给人捉住了，关在枣子桶里，当货物一般给搬来搬去，师父你可别见怪。”	'Like being captured by someone bigger and stronger than me and shut up in a barrel of dates and pushed around like goods to market. You mustn't blame me for things like that.'
陈近南皱起眉头，又好气，又好笑，叹了口长气，说道：“收你为徒，只怕是我生平所作的一件大错事。	The Helmsman found he didn't quite know whether to be angry or amused. Finally he gave a sigh. 'I'm beginning to think that taking you on as my apprentice may prove to be the biggest mistake of my life.
但以天下大事为重，只好冒一冒险。	There's so much that hangs on this though, I just have to take the chance.
小宝，待会另有要务，你一切听我吩咐行事，少胡说八道，那就不错。”	Now listen, Trinket. There's going to be some important business presently. Just keep quiet, do everything I tell you, and don't talk a lot of nonsense, and you'll be all right.
	Is that understood?'
韦小宝道：“是！”	'Yes, sir,' said Trinket.
陈近南见他欲言又止，问道：“你还想说什么？”	Observing that Trinket appeared to be hesitating, the Helmsman asked him if there was something else he wanted to say.
韦小宝道：“徒儿说话，总是自以为有理才说。	'It's only that what I say always does seem sensible to me, ' said Trinket.
我并不想胡说八道，你却说我胡说八道，那岂不冤枉么？”	'I never mean to talk nonsense. So when you tell me I'm talking nonsense, it seems unfair.'
陈近南不愿再跟他多所纠缠，说道：“那你少说几句好了。”	'In that case the best thing is not to talk at all,' said the Helmsman.
心想：“天下不知多少成名的英雄好汉，在我面前都是恭恭敬敬，大气也不敢透一声，这个刁蛮古怪的顽童，偏有这许多废话。”	But what he thought was, 'How many men of valour and reputation have I seen behaving like submissive flunkeys and hardly daring to breathe in my presence, yet this two-faced, shifty little urchin can stand here and give me all this lip!'
站起身来，走向门口，道：“你跟我来。”	He got up and strode towards the door. 'Come on,' he said. 'Follow me.'
韦小宝抢着开门，掀开门帷，让陈近南出去，跟着他来到大厅。	Trinket rushed to open it for him and held up the door-curtain for him to go through. Then he followed him to the hall.
